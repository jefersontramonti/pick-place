General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

7.1

Language Definition Aids

SCL Language
Definition

The language definition is based on syntax diagrams. These provide you with
a good overview of the syntactical (in other words grammatical) structure of
SCL. Appendix B of this manual contains a collection of all the diagrams
with the language elements.

What is a Syntax
Diagram?

A syntax diagram is a graphical representation of the structure of the
language. The structure is created using a hierarchical sequence of rules.
Each rule can be based on preceding rules.
Name of rule

Sequence
Block 3
Block 1

Block 2

Option

Block 4
Block 5

Iteration
Alternative
Figure 7-1

Syntax Diagram

The syntax diagram is read from right to left. The following rule structures
must be adhered to:

S Sequence: sequence of blocks
S Option: skippable branch
S Iteration: repetition of branches
S Alternative: multiple branch
What Types of
Block are there?

A block is a fundamental element or an element that itself is made up of
blocks. The symbols used to represent the various types of block are
illustrated below:

Basic element that requires no further
explanation.

Complex element that is described
by other syntax diagrams.

These are printable characters or special
characters, keywords and predefined
identifiers.
The details of these blocks are copied
unchanged.


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

What Does Free
Format Mean?

When writing source code, the programmer must observe not only the syntax
rules but also lexical rules.
The lexical and syntax rules are described in detail in Appendices B and C.
Free format means that you can insert formatting characters such as spaces,
tabs and page breaks as well as comments between the rule blocks.


## Lexical Rules


In the case of lexical rules such as the example in Figure 7-2, there is no
freedom of format. When you apply a lexical rule, you must adopt the
specifications exactly as set out.

The SCL Character Set

Letters and
Numeric
Characters

SCL uses the following subset of the ASCII character set:

S The upper and lower case letters A to Z
S The Arabic numbers 0 to 9
S The space character (ASCII value 32) and all control characters (ASCII
0-31) including the end of line character (ASCII 13)

Other Characters

Other Information


The following characters have a specific meaning in SCL:
+

–

*

/

=

<

>

[

Identifiers in SCL

Definition

An identifier is a name that you assign to an SCL language object, in other
words to a constant, a variable, a function or a block.

Rules

Identifiers can be made up of letters or numbers in any order but the first
character must be either a letter or the underscore character. Both upper and
lowercase letters are permitted. As with keywords, identifiers are not
case-sensitive (Anna and AnNa are, for example, identical).
An identifier can be formally represented by the following syntax diagram:
IDENTIFIER
Letter

Syntax of an Identifier

Please note the following points:

S When choosing names for identifiers, it is advisable to use unambiguous
and self-explanatory names which add to the comprehensibility of the
program.

S You should check that the name is not already in use by a standard
identifier or a keyword (for example, as in Table 7-1).

S The maximum length of an identifier is 24 characters.
S Symbolic names for blocks (that is, other identifiers as in Table 7-1) must
be defined in the STEP 7 symbol table (for details refer to /231/ ).

**Examples:**

The following names are examples of valid identifiers:
x

y12

Sum

Temperature

Name

Surface

Controller

Table

The following names are not valid identifiers for the reasons specified:
4th

The first character must be a letter or an underscore character

Array

ARRAY is a keyword and is not permitted.

S Value

Spaces are characters and not allowed.

7.5

Standard Identifiers

Definition

In SCL, a number of identifiers are predefined and are therefore called
standard identifiers. These standard identifiers are as follows:

S the block keywords and
S the address identifiers for addressing memory areas of the CPU.
Block Keywords

These standard identifiers are used for absolute addressing of blocks.
Table 7-1 is sorted in the order of the SIMATIC mnemonics and the
corresponding international IEC mnemonics are also shown.

7.6

Numbers

Summary

There are several ways in which you can write numbers in SCL. A number
can have a plus or minus sign, a decimal point, and an exponent. The
following rules apply to all numbers:

S A number must not contain commas or spaces.
S To create a visual separation between numbers, the underscore character
(_) can be used.

S The number can be preceded if required by a plus ( + ) or minus ( – )
sign. If the number is not preceded by a sign, it is assumed to be positive.

S Numbers must not be outside certain maximum and minimum limits.
Integers

An integer contains neither a decimal point nor an exponent. This means that
an integer is simply a sequence of digits that can be preceded by a plus or
minus sign. Two integer types are implemented in SCL, INT und DINT, each
of which has a different permissible range of values (see Chapter 9).
Examples of valid integers:
0

1

+1

–1

743

–5280

600_00

–32_211

The following integers are illegal for the reasons stated in each case:

Integers as Binary,
Octal or
Hexadecimal
Numbers

123,456

Integers must not contain commas.

36.

Integers must not contain a decimal point.

10 20 30

Integers must not contain spaces.

In SCL, you can also represent integers in different numerical systems. To do
this, the number is preceded by a keyword for the numerical system. The
keyword 2# stands for the binary system, 8# for the octal system and 16# for
the hexadecimal system.
Valid integers for decimal 15:
2#1111

Real Numbers

8#17

16#F

A real number must contain either a decimal point or an exponent (or both).
A decimal point must be between two numeric characters. This means that a
real number cannot start or end with a decimal point.
Examples of valid real numbers:


0.0

1.0

–0.2

827.602

50000.0

–0.000743

12.3

–315.0066


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

The following real numbers are illegal:
1.

There must be a number on both sides of the decimal point.

1,000.0

Real numbers must not contain commas.

.3333

There must be a number on both sides of the decimal point.

A real number can include an exponent in order to specify the position of the
decimal point. If the number contains no decimal point, it is assumed that it
is to the right of the number. The exponent itself must be either a positive or
a negative integer. Base 10 is represented by the letter E.
The value 3 x 10 10 can be correctly represented in SCL by the following real
numbers:
3.0E+10

3.0E10

3e+10

3E10

0.3E+11

0.3e11

30.0E+9

30e9

The following real numbers are illegal:

Character Strings

3.E+10

There must be a number on both sides of the decimal point.

8e2.3

The exponent must be an integer.

.333e–3

There must be a number on both sides of the decimal point.

30 E10

Spaces are not allowed.

A character string is a sequence of characters (in other words letters,
numbers, or special characters) set in quotation marks. Both upper and
lowercase letters can be used.
Examples of permissible character strings:
’RED’

’7500 Karlsruhe’

’270–32–3456’

’DM19.95’ ’The correct answer is:’
You can enter special formatting characters, the single quotation mark ( ’ ) or
a $ character by using the alignment symbol $.
Source Code

After Compilation

’SIGNAL$’RED’
’50.0$$’
’VALUE$P’
’REG-$L’
’CONTROLLER$R
’STEP$T’

SIGNAL’RED’
50.0$
VALUE Page break
REG Line feed
CONTROLLER Carriage return
STEP
Tab

To enter non-printing characters, type in the substitute representation in
hexadecimal code in the form $hh, where hh stands for the hexadecimal
value of the ASCII character.
To enter comments in a character string that are not intended to be printed
out or displayed, you use the characters $> and $< to enclose the comments.

## Data Types


Summary

A declaration of a variable must always specify what data type that variable
is. The data type determines the permissible range of values for the variable
and the operations that it can be used to perform.
The data type determines

S the type and interpretation of a data element,
S the permissible range of values for a data element,
S the permissible number of operations that can be performed by an address
of a variable, and

S the format of the data of that data type.
Types of Data Type

The following types of data type are distinguished:
Table 7-2

Elementary Data Types
Explanation

Elementary Data
Types

Elementary data types define the structure of data elements which can not be
subdivided into smaller units. They conform to the definition given in the
standard DIN EN 1131-3.
SCL has twelve predefined elementary data types as follows:
BOOL

INT

TIME

BYTE

DINT

DATE

WORD

REAL

TIME_OF_DAY

DWORD


CHAR

S5TIME


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

Complex Data
Types

Complex data types define the structure of data elements which are made up
of a combination of other data elements. SCL allows the following complex
data types:
DATE_AND_TIME
STRING
ARRAY
STRUCT

User-Defined Data
Types

These are global data types (UDTs) which can be created in SCL for
user-specific applications. This data type can be used with its UDT identifier
UDTx (x represents a number) or an assigned symbolic name in the
declaration section of a block or data block.

Parameter Types

In addition to elementary, complex and user-defined data types, you can also
use parameter types for defining parameters. SCL provides the following
parameter types for that purpose:
TIMER

BLOCK_FB

COUNTER

BLOCK_FC

POINTER

ANY

BLOCK_DB
BLOCK_SDB


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

7.8

Variables

Declaration of
Variables

An identifier whose assigned value can change during the process of
execution of a program is called a variable. Each variable must be
individually declared (that is, defined) before it can be used in a logic block
or data block. The declaration of a variable specifies that an identifier is a
variable (rather than a constant, etc.) and defines the variable type by
assigning it to a data type.
The following types of variable are distinguished on the basis of their
applicability:

S Local data
S Global user data
S Permissible predefined variables (CPU memory areas)
Local Data

Local data are declared in a logic block (FC, FB, OB) and apply only within
that logic block. Specifically these are the following:
Table 7-3

Local Data of a Block

Variable Type


Explanation

Static Variables

A static variable is a local variable whose value is retained
throughout all block cycles (block memory). It is used for
storing values for a function block.

Temporary Variables

Temporary variables belong to a local logic block and do not
occupy any static memory. Their values are retained for a
single block cycle only. Temporary variables can not be
accessed from outside the block in which they are declared.

Block Parameters

Block parameters are formal parameters of a function block.
or a function. They are local variables that are used to pass
over the current parameters specified when a block is called.


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

Global
User-Defined Data

These are data or data areas that can be accessed from any point in a
program. To use global user-defined variables, you must create data blocks
(DBs).
When you create a DB, you define its structure in a structure declaration.
Instead of a structure declaration, you can use a user-defined data type
(UDT). The order in which you specify the structural components determines
the sequence of the data in the DB.

CPU Memory
Areas

You can access the memory areas of a CPU directly from any point in the
program via the address identifiers (see Section 7.5) without having to
declare those variables first.
Apart from that, you can always address those memory areas symbolically.
Assignment of symbols is performed globally in this case by means of the
symbol table in STEP 7. For more details, refer to /231/.


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

7.9

Expressions

Summary

An expression stands for a value that is calculated either when the program is
compiled or when it is running. It consists of one or more addresses linked by
operators. The order in which the operators are applied is determined by their
priority and can also be controlled by bracketing.

S Mathematical expressions
S Logical expressions
S Comparative expressions
Mathematical
Expressions

A typical example of a mathematical expression is
(b*b–4*a*c)/(2*a)
The identifiers a and b and the numbers 4 and 2 are the addresses, the
symbols *, – and / are the corresponding operators (multiply, subtract and
divide). The complete expression represents a numerical value.

Comparative
Expressions

A comparative expression is a logical expression that can be either true or
false. The following is an example of a comparative expression:
Setpoint < 100.0
In this expression, SETPOINT is a real variable, 100.0 a real number and
the symbol < a comparator. The expression has the value True if the value of
Setpoint is less than 100.0. If it is not, the value of the expression is False.

Logical
Expression

The following is a typical example of a logical expression:
a AND NOT b
The identifiers a and b are the addresses, the keywords AND and NOT are
logical operators. The complete expression represents a bit pattern.


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms


## 7.10 Statements


Summary

An SCL statement is an executable action in the code section of a logic
block. There are three basic types of statements in SCL:

S Value assignments (assignment of an expression to a variable)
S Control statements (repetition or branching statements)
S Subroutine calls (statements calling or branching to other logic blocks)
Value
Assignments

The following is an example of a typical value assignment:
SETPOINT := 0.99*PREV_SETPOINT
This example assumes that SETPOINT and PREV_SETPOINT are real
variables. The assignment instruction multiplies the value of
PREV_SETPOINT by 0.99 and assigns the product to the variable
SETPOINT. Note that the symbol for assignment is := .

Control
Statements

The following is an example of a typical control statement:
FOR Count :=1 TO 20 DO
LIST[Counter]

:= VALUE+Counter;

END_FOR;
In the above example, the statement is performed 20 times over. Each time,
the recalculated value in the array LIST is entered in the next highest
position on the list.

Subroutine Call

By specifying a block identifier for a function (FC) or a function block (FB)
you can call the block declared for that identifier. 1 If the declaration of the
logic block includes formal parameters, then current addresses can be
assigned to the formal parameters when the formal parameters are called.
All parameters listed in the declaration sections
VAR_INPUT, VAR_OUTPUT and VAR_IN_OUT
of a logic block are referred to as formal parameters - in contrast, the
corresponding parameters included in the subroutine calls within the code
section are termed actual parameters.
Assignment of the actual parameters to the formal parameters is part of the
subroutine call.
The following is a typical example of a subroutine call:
FC31(X:=5, S1:=Sumdigits);

KEIN MERKER
If you have declared formal parameters in a function, the assignment of current parameters is
mandatory, with function blocks it is optional.

following types of block:

OB

FC

FB

DB

UDT

STEP 7 Blocks

Ready-Made
Blocks

You do not have to program every function yourself. You can also make use
of various ready-made blocks. They are to be found in the CPU operating
system or libraries (S7lib) in the STEP7 Standard Package and can be used
for programming communication functions, for example.

Structure of an
SCL Block

All blocks consist of the following components:

S Start/end of block header (keyword corresponding to block type)
S Declaration section
S Code section (assignment section in the case of data blocks)


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

Declaration
Section

The declaration section must contain all specifications required to create the
basis for the code section, for example, definition of constants and
declaration of variables and parameters.

Code Section

The code section is introduced by the keyword BEGIN and terminated with a
standard identifier for the end of block; that is, END_xxx (see Section 8.2).
Every statement is concluded with a semicolon (“ ; ”). Each statement can
also be preceded by a jump label. The syntax rules for the code section and
the individual statements themselves are explained in Chapter 13.
Code Section

LABEL1

Y := Y+10;
Z := X*Y;
:
GOTO LABEL1

LABELn;

FC10 := Z;//End of code section

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

In the code section of a data block, you can assign initialization values to
your DB data. For that reason, the code section of a DB is referred to from
now on as the assignment section.
S7 Program

Following compilation, the blocks generated are stored in the “Blocks” folder
of the S7 program. From here, they must be downloaded to the CPU. For
details of how this is done, refer to /231/.

## 7.12 Comments


Summary

Comments are used for documentation and to provide an explanation of an
SCL block. After compilation, comments have no effect whatsoever on the
running of the program. There are the following two types of comments:

S Line comments
S Block comments
Line Comments

These are comments introduced by a double slash // and extending no further
than the end of the line. The length of such comments is limited to a
maximum of 253 characters including the identifying characters //. Line
comments can be represented by the following syntax diagram:
Line Comment

CR

Syntax of a Line Comment

For details of the printing characters, please refer to Table A-2 in the
Appendix. The character pairings using ‘(*’ and ‘*)’ have no significance
inside line comments.
Block Comments

These are comments which can extend over a number of lines and are
introduced as a block by ‘(*’ and terminated by ‘*)’. The nesting of block
comments is permitted as standard. You can, however, change this setting
and make the nesting of block comments impossible.
Block Comment

Syntax of a Block Comment

For details of the permissible characters, please refer to Table A-2 in the
Appendix.


General Introduction to Basic SCL Terms

Points to Note

Observe the notation for comments:

S With block comments in data blocks, you must use the notation for block
comments that is, these comments are also introduced with ‘//’.

S Nesting of comments is permitted in the default setting. This compiler
setting can, however, be modified with the “Permit Nested Comments”
option. To change the setting, select the menu command Options
Customize and deselect the option in the “Compiler” tab page.

S Comments must not be placed in the middle of a symbolic name or a
constant. They may, however, be placed in the middle of a string.
The following comment is illegal:
(*// FUNCTION_BLOCK // Adaptation *)

Example of the
Use of Comments

The example shows two block comments and one line comment.
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB15
(* At this point there is a remarks block
which can extend over a number of lines *)
VAR
SWITCH: INT; //

Line comments

END_VAR;
BEGIN
(* Assign a value to the variable SWITCH *)
SWITCH:= 3;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

Figure 7-10

Example for Comments

Note
Line comments which come directly after the variable declaration of a block
are copied to an STL program on decompilation.
You can find these comments in STL in the interface area; that is, in the
upper part of the window (see also /231/).

In the example in Figure 7-10, therefore, the first line comment would be
copied.

Structure of an SCL Source File

8.1

Structure

Introduction

An SCL source file consists of the source code made up of between 1 and n
blocks (that is, FBs, FCs, OBs, DBs and UDTs).
In order that the individual blocks can be compiled from your SCL source
file, they must must conform to specific structures and syntax rules.

Figure 8-1

Order of Blocks

SCL Program Subunit

With regard to the order of the blocks, the following rules must be observed
when creating the source file:
Called blocks must precede the calling blocks. This means:

S User-defined data types (UDTs) must precede the blocks in which they
are used.

S Data blocks with an assigned user-defined data type (UDT) must follow
the UDT.

S Data blocks that can be accessed by all logic blocks must precede all
blocks which access them.

S Data blocks with an assigned function block come after the function
block.

S The organization block OB1, which calls other blocks, comes at the very
end. Blocks which are called by blocks called by OB1 must precede those
blocks.
Blocks that you call in a source file, but that you do not program in the same
source file must exist already when the file is compiled into the user
program.

Structure

The source code for a block consists of the following sections:

S Block start with specification of the block (absolute or symbolic)
S Block attributes (optional)
S Declaration section (differs from block type to block type)
S Code section in logic blocks or assignment of current values in data
blocks (optional)

S Block end

Beginning and End of a Block

Introduction

Depending on the type of block, the source text for a single block is
introduced by a standard identifier for the start of the block and the block
name. It is closed with a standard identifier for the end of the block (see
Table 8-1).

Declaration Section

Overview

The declaration section is used for defining local and global variables,
parameters, constants, and jump labels.

S The local variables, parameters, constants, and jump labels that are to
apply within a particular block only are defined in the declaration section
of the code block.

S The global data that can be addressed by any code block are defined in
the DB declaration section.

S In the declaration section of a UDT, you specify the user-defined data
type.
Structure

A declaration section is divided into a number of declaration subsections,
each delimited by its own pair of keywords. Each subsection contains a
declaration list for data of a particular type, such as constants, labels, static
data and temporary data. Each subsection type may only occur once and not
every subsection type is allowed in every type of block, as shown in the
table. There is no fixed order in which the subsections have to be arranged.

Structure of a Function Block (FB)

Overview

A function block (FB) is a logic block constituting part of a program and
having a memory area assigned to it. Whenever an FB is called, an instance
DB (see Chapter 10) must be assigned to it. You specify the structure of this
instance DB when you define the FB declaration section.

FB Declaration
Section

The FB declaration section is used to establish the block-specific data. For
details of the permissible declaration subsections, refer to Section 8.4. Note
that the declaration section also determines the structure of the assigned

8.8

Structure of a Function (FC)

Overview

A function (FC) is a logic block that is not assigned its own memory area.
For this reason, it does not require an instance DB. In contrast to an FB, a
function can return a function result (return value) to the point from which it
was called. A function can therefore be used like a variable in an expression.
Functions of the type VOID do not have a return value.

## 8.10 Structure of a Data Block (DB)


Overview

A data block (DB) contains global user-specific data which is to be
accessible to all blocks in the program. Each FB, FC or OB can read or write
data from/to global DBs. The structure of data blocks which are assigned to
specific FBs only (instance DBs) is described in Chapter 12.

## 8.11 Structure of a User-Defined Data Type (UDT)


Overview

User-defined data types (UDTs) are special data structures created by the
user. Since user-defined data types are assigned names they can be used
many times over. By virtue of their definition, they can be used at any point
in the CPU program and are thus global data types. As such, they can
therefore

S be used in blocks in the same way as elementary or complex data types,
or

S be used as templates for creating data blocks with the same data structure.

## Data Types


Introduction

Chapter
Overview

A data type is the combination of value ranges and operations into a single
unit. SCL, like most other programming languages, has a number of
predefined data types (that is, integrated in the language). In addition, the
programmer can create complex and user-defined data types.

Elementary Data Types

Overview

Elementary data types define the structure of data elements that cannot be
subdivided into smaller units. They correspond to the definition given in the
standard DIN EN 1131-3. An elementary data type defines a memory area of
a fixed size and represents bit, integer, real, period, time and character
values. These data types are all predefined in SCL.

## Data Types


9.3

Complex Data Types

Overview

SCL supports the following complex data types:
Table 9-3

Complex Data Types

Data Type

Description

Defines an area of 64 bits (8 bytes). This data type stores date
DATE_AND_TIME and time (as a binary coded decimal) and is a predefined data
DT
type in SCL.
STRING

Defines an area for a character string of up to 254 characters
(DATA TYPE CHAR).

ARRAY

Defines an array consisting of elements of one data type (either
elementary or complex).

STRUCT


Defines a group of data types in any combination of types. It
can be an array of structures or a structure of structures and
arrays.


## Data Types


9.3.1

DATE_AND_TIME Data Type

Overview

The data type DATE_AND_TIME is made up of the data types DATE and
TIME. It defines an area of 64 bits (8 bytes) for specifying the date and time.
The data area stores the following information (in binary coded decimal
format): year–month–day–hours: minutes: seconds.milliseconds.

Note
There are standard FCs available for accessing the specific components
DATE or TIME.


## Data Types


9.3.2

STRING Data Type

Overview

A STRING data type defines a character string with a maximum of
254 characters.
The standard area reserved for a character string consists of 256 bytes. This is
the memory area required to store 254 characters and a header consisting of
two bytes.
You can reduce the memory required by a character string by defining a
maximum number of characters to be saved in the string. A null string, in
other words a string containing no data, is the smallest possible value.

Value Range

Any characters in the ASCII character set are permitted in a character string.
Chapter 11 describes how control characters and non-printing characters are
treated.
Note
In the case of return values, input and in/out parameters, the standard length
of the data type STRING can be reduced from 254 characters to a number of
your choice, in order to make better use of the resources on your CPU.
Select the Customize menu command in the Options menu and then the
“Compiler” tab. Here, you can enter the required number of characters in the
“Maximum String Length” option box.


## Data Types


9.3.3

ARRAY Data Type

Overview

The array data type has a specified number of components of particular data
type. In the syntax diagram for arrays shown in Figure. 9-3, the data type is
precisely specified by means of the reserved word OF. SCL distinguishes
between the following types of array:

S The one-dimensional ARRAY type.
(This is a list of data elements arranged in ascending order).

S The two-dimensional ARRAY type.
(This is a table of data consisting of rows and columns. The first
dimension refers to the row number and the second to the column
number).

S The multidimensional ARRAY type.
(This is an extension of the two-dimensional ARRAY type adding further
dimensions. The maximum number of dimensions permitted is six).

This describes the dimensions of the ARRAY data type as follows:

S The smallest and highest possible index (index range) for each dimension.
The index can have any integer value (–32768 to 32767).

S The limits must be separated by two full stops.
S The individual index ranges must be separated by commas. The entire
index specification is enclosed in square brackets.
Data Type
Specification

The data type specification is used to declare the data type of the array
components. The permissible data types are all those detailed in this section.
The data type of an ARRAY can also be a structure.
The following specifications are examples of possible array types:
ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL
ARRAY[1..10] OF STRUCT..END_STRUCT
ARRAY[1..100, 1..10] OF REAL


## Data Types


9.3.4

STRUCT Data Type

Overview

A STRUCT data type describes an area consisting of a fixed number of
components that can be of different data types. These data elements are
specified in Figure 9-4 immediately following the STRUCT keyword in the
component declaration. The main feature of the STRUCT data type is that a
data element within it can also be structured. This means that nesting of
STRUCT data types is permitted. Chapter 10 explains how to access the data
of a structure.

User-Defined Data Type (UDT)

Overview

As explained in Chapter 8, a UDT data type is defined as a block. By virtue
of its definition, such a data type can be used at any point of the CPU
program and is thus a global data type. You can use these data types with
their UDT name, UDTx (x represents a number), or with an assigned
symbolic name defined in the declaration section of a block or data block.

END_TYPE

Syntax of a User-Defined Data Type (UDT)

UDT Name

A declaration for a UDT is introduced by the keyword TYPE followed by the
name of the UDT (UDT identifier). The name of the UDT can either be
specified in absolute form, that is, by a standard name in the form UDTx (x
stands for a number), or else a symbolic name can be used (see also Chapter
8).

Data Type
Specification

The UDT name is followed by the data type specification. The only data type
specification permissible in this case is STRUCT (see Section 9.3.4).
STRUCT
:
END_STRUCT
Subsequently, the complete declaration for the UDT is concluded with the
keyword
END_TYPE

Using UDTs

The data type thus defined can be used for variables or parameters or
declaring DBs. Components of structures or arrays, including those inside
other UDTs, can also be declared by means of UDTs.
Note
When assigning initial values (initialization) within a UDT, STL syntax
applies. For information on how to write constants, consult the user manual
/231/ or manual /232/.


## Data Types


**Example:**

The example below illustrates the definition of a UDT and the use of this
data type within a variable declaration. It is assumed that the name
”MEASDATA” has been declared for UDT50 in the symbol table.
TYPE MEASDATA // UDT Definition

BIPOL_2 : WORD := W16AFAL;
BIPOL_3 : BYTE := B16FF;

Parameter Types

Overview

In addition to elementary, complex and user-defined data types, you can also
use so-called parameter types for specifying the formal block parameters for
FBs and FCs. These data types are used for the following:

S declaring timer/counter functions as parameters (TIMER/COUNTER),
S declaring FCs, FBs, DBs and SDBs as parameters ( BLOCK_xx)
S allowing an address of any data type as a parameter (ANY)
S allowing a memory area as a parameter (POINTER)
Table 9-5

Parameter Types

Parameter

Size

Description

TIMER

2 bytes

Identifies a specific timer to be used by the program in the
logic block called.
Actual parameter:
e.g. T1

COUNTER

2 bytes

Identifies a specific counter to be used by the program in the
logic block called.

Actual parameter:

e.g. C10

BLOCK_FB
BLOCK_FC
BLOCK_DB
BLOCK_SDB

2 bytes

Identifies a specific block to be used by the program in the
block called.
Actual parameter:
e.g. FC101
DB42

ANY

10 bytes Used if any data type with the exception of ANY is to be
allowed for the data type of the actual parameter.

POINTER

6 bytes

Identifies a particular memory area to be used by the
program.
Actual parameter:
e.g. M50.0

TIMER and
COUNTER

You specify a particular timer or a counter to be used when processing a
block. The TIMER and COUNTER data types are only permitted for input
parameters (VAR_INPUT).

BLOCK Types

You specify a certain block to be used as an input parameter. The declaration
of the input parameter determines the type of block (FB, FC or DB). When
supplying parameters, you specify the absolute block identifier either in
absolute form (for example, FB20) or by a symbolic name.
SCL does not provide any operations which manipulate these data types.
Parameters of this type can only be supplied with data in the course of
subroutine calls. In the case of FCs, input parameters cannot be passed on.


## Data Types


In SCL, you can assign addresses to the following data types as actual
parameters:

S Function blocks without formal parameters
S Function blocks without formal parameters and return value (VOID)
S Data blocks and system data blocks.
ANY

In SCL it is possible to declare block parameters of the data type ANY. When
such a block is called, these parameters can be supplied with addresses of any
data type. SCL, however, provides only one method of processing the ANY
data type, namely passing on to underlying blocks.
You can assign addresses of the following data types as the actual parameter:

S Elementary data types
You specify the absolute address or the symbolic name of the actual
parameter.

S Complex data types
You specify the symbolic name of the data and the complex data type.

S ANY data type
This is only possible when the address is a parameter type that does not
clash with the formal parameter.

S NIL data type
You specify a zero pointer.

S Timers, counters, and blocks
You specify the identifier (for example, T1, C20 or FB6).
The data type ANY is permitted for formal input parameters, in/out
parameters of FBs and FCs, and for output parameters of FCs.
Note
If you supply a temporary variable to a formal parameter of the ANY type
when an FB or FC is called, you must not pass on this parameter to a further
block in the block that was called. The addresses of temporary variables lose
their validity when they are passed on.


## Data Types


POINTER

In SCL, you can declare block parameters of the POINTER data type and can
supply these parameters with addresses of any data type when such a block is
called. SCL, however, provides only one method of processing the ANY data
type, namely passing on to underlying blocks.
You can assign addresses of the following data types as the actual parameter
in SCL:

S Elementary data types
You specify the absolute address or the symbolic name of the actual
parameter.

S Complex data types
You specify the symbolic name of the data and the complex data type (for
example arrays and structures).

S POINTER data type
This is only possible when the address is a parameter type that does not
clash with the formal parameter.

S NIL data type
You specify a zero pointer.
The POINTER data type is permitted for formal input parameters, in/out
parameters of FBs and FCs and for output parameters of FCs.
Note
If you supply a temporary variable to a formal parameter of the POINTER
type when an FB or FC is called, you must not pass on this parameter to a
further block in the block that was called. The addresses of temporary
variables lose their validity when they are passed on.

## 10.1 Overview


Categorization of
Variables

Local variables can be subdivided into the categories shown in Table 10-1:
Table 10-1

Local Variables
Explanation

Variable

Categorization of
Block Parameters

Static Variables

Static variables are local variables whose value is retained
throughout all block cycles (block memory). They are used
to store values for a function block and are stored in the
instance data block.

Temporary Variables

Temporary variables belong to a logic block at local level
and do not occupy a static memory area, since they are
stored in the CPU stack. Their values are retained only for
the duration of a single block cycle. Temporary variables
can not be accessed from outside the block in which they
are declared.

Block parameters are placeholders that are definitely specified only when the
block is actually used (called). The placeholders in the block are termed
formal parameters and the values assigned to them when the block is called
are referred to as the actual parameters. The formal parameters of a block can
be viewed as local variables.
Block parameters can be subdivided into the categories shown in Table 10-2:
Table 10-2

Block Parameters

Block Parameter Type

Flags (OK Flag)


Explanation

Input Parameters

Input parameters accept the current input
values when the block is called. They are
read-only.

Output parameters

Output parameters transfer the current
output values to the calling block. Data
can be written to and read from them.

In/out parameters

In/out parameters copy the current value
of a variable when the block is called,
process it and write the result back to the
original variable.

The SCL compiler provides a flag which can be used for detecting errors
when running programs on the CPU. It is a local variable of the type BOOL
with the predefined name “OK”.


Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


## Declaring

Variables
and Parameters

As shown in Table 10-3, each category of local variables or parameters is
assigned as well a separate declaration subsection as its own pair of
keywords.
Each subsection contains the declarations that are permitted for that
particular declaration subsection. Each subsection may only appear once in
the declaration section of the block. There is no specified order in which the
subsections have to be placed.
The declaration subsections permitted within a particular block are marked
with an “x” in Table 10-3.

Initialization

When they are declared, the variables and parameters must be assigned a
data type which determines the structure and thereby the memory
requirements. In addition, you can also assign static variables and function
block parameters initial values. Table 10-4 summarizes the situations in
which initialization is possible.

## 10.2 Declaring Variables and Parameters


Summary

A variable or parameter declaration consists of a user-definable identifier for
the variable name and details of the data type. The basic format is shown in
the syntax diagram below. Assigning system attributes for parameters is
described in Section 8.4.

All data types dealt with in Chapter 9 are permissible.
Note
Reserved words, which are only valid in SCL, can be declared as identifiers
by putting the character “#” in front (for example, #FOR). This can be useful
if you want to transfer the actual parameters to blocks which were created in
a different language (for example, STL).


Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


## 10.3 Initialization


Principle

Static variables, input parameters and output parameters of an FB can be
assigned an initial value when they are declared. The initialization is
performed by means of a value assignment ( := ) which follows the data type
specification. As shown in the syntax diagram in Figure 10-2, you can either:

S assign a simple variable a constant or
S assign an array an initialization list

Note that initialization of a list of variables ( A1, A2, A3,...: INT:=...) is not
possible. In such cases, the variables have to be initialized individually.
Arrays are initialized as shown in Figure 10-3.

## 10.4 Instance Declaration


Summary

Apart from the elementary, complex and user-defined variables already
mentioned, you can also declare variables of the type FB or SFB in the
declaration section of function blocks. Such variables are called local
instances of the FB or SFB.
The local instance data is stored in the instance data block of the calling
function block.

you can:

S Declare variable names and data types in a variable declaration with
initialization if required (see Section 10.2)

S Insert existing variable declarations using an instance declaration (see
Section 10.4).
After compilation, this subsection together with the subsections for the block
parameters determines the structure of the assigned instance data block.

**Example:**

Declaration of Static Variables

The variables are accessed from the code section as follows:

S Internal access: that is, from the code section of the function block in
whose declaration section the variable is declared. This is explained in
Chapter 14 (Value Assignments).

S External access via the instance DB: by way of the indexed variable
DBx.variable. DBx is the data block name.


Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


## 10.6 Temporary Variables


Overview

Temporary variables belong to a logic block locally and do not occupy any
static memory area. They are located in the stack of the CPU. The value only
exists while a block is being processed. Temporary variables cannot be
accessed outside the block in which they are declared.
You should declare data as temporary data if you only require it to record
interim results during the processing of your OB, FB or FC.

Section 10.2).


**Example:**

Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


## 10.7 Block Parameters

Overview

Block parameters are formal parameters of a function block or a function.
When the function block or function is called, the actual parameters replace
the formal parameters, thus forming a mechanism for exchange of data
between the called block and the calling block.

S Formal input parameters are assigned the actual input values
(inward flow of data)

S Formal output parameters are used to transfer output values
(outward flow of data)

S Formal in/out parameters have the function of both an input and an output
parameter.
For more detailed information about the use of parameters and the associated
exchange of data, refer to Chapter 16.

Syntax of Parameter Subsection

The declaration subsection is a component of an FB or FC. In it, the variable
name and assigned data type are specified within the variable declaration see
Section 10.2.
After compilation of an FB, these subsections together with the subsection
delimited by VAR and END_VAR determine the structure of the assigned
instance data block.


Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


**Example:**

Example 10-6 below illustrates the declaration of a parameter:

VAR_INPUT

END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT

//Output parameter

SETPOINTS: ARRAY [1..10] of INT;
END_VAR

VAR_IN_OUT

//In/out parameter

EINSTELLUNG: INT;
END_VAR


**Example:**

Access


Declaration of Parameters

Block parameters are accessed from the code section of a logic block as
follows:

S Internal access: that is, from the code section of the block in whose
declaration section the parameter is declared. This is explained in
Chapter 14 (Value Assignments) and Chapter 13 (Expressions, Operators
and Addresses).

S External access by way of instance data block. You can access block
parameters of function blocks via the assigned instance DB (see
Section 14.8).


Declaring Local Variables and Block Parameters


## 10.8 Flags (OK Flag)


Description

The OK flag is used to indicate the correct or incorrect execution of a block.
It is a global variable of the type BOOL identified by the keyword ”OK”.
If an error occurs when a block statement is being executed (for example
overflow during multiplication), the OK flag is set to FALSE. When the
block is quit, the value of the OK flag is saved in the implicitly defined
output parameter ENO (Section 16.4) and can thus be read by the calling
block.
When the block is first called, the OK flag has the value TRUE. It can be
read or set to TRUE / FALSE at any point in the block by means of SCL
statements.

Declaration

The OK flag is a system variable. Declaration is not necessary. However, you
do have to select the compiler option ”OK Flag” before compiling the source
file if you wish to use the OK flag in your application program.


**Example:**

Example 10-7 below illustrates the use of the OK flag.
// Set OK variable to TRUE
// in order to be able to check
// whether the operation below
// is performed successfully
OK: = TRUE;
SUM: = SUM + IN;
IF OK THEN
// Addition completed successfully
:
:
ELSE

// Addition not completed successfully
:

END_IF;

Declaring Constants and Jump Labels

Introduction

11

Constants are data elements that have a fixed value which can not be altered
while the program is running. If the value of a constant is expressed by its
format, it is termed a literal constant.
You do not have to declare constants. However, you have the option of
assigning symbolic names for constants in the declaration section.
Jump labels represent the names of jump command destinations within the
code section of the logic block.
Symbolic names of constants and jump labels are declared separately in their
own declaration subsections.

Assigning Data
Types to
Constants

A constant is assigned the data type whose value range is just sufficient to
accommodate the constant without loss of data. When using constants in an
expression (for example, in a value assignment), the data type of the target
variable must incorporate the value of the constant. If, for example, an
integer literal is specified whose value exceeds the integer range, it is
assumed that it is a double integer. The compiler returns an error message if
you assign this value to a variable of the type Integer.

## 11.3 Formats for Integer and Real Number Literals


Overview

SCL provides the following formats for numerical values:

S Integer literals for whole number values
S Real number literals for floating point numbers
In both of the above literals, you use a string of digits which must conform to
the structure shown in Figure 11-2. This string of digits is referred to simply
as a decimal digit string in the syntax diagrams below.

Digit String in a Literal

The decimal number in a literal consists of a string of digits which may also
be separated by underscore characters. The underscores are used to improve
readability in the case of long numbers.

You can specify an integer literal in a numeric system other than the decimal
system by using the prefixes 2#, 8# or 16# followed by the number in the
notation of the selected system. You can use the underscore character within
a number to make longer numbers easier to read.

## 11.4 Formats for Character and String Literals

Summary

SCL also provides the facility for entering and processing text data, for
example a character string to be displayed as a message.
Calculations can not be performed on character literals, which means that
character literals can not be used in expressions. A distinction is made
between

S character literals, that is, single characters, and
S string literals, that is, a character string of up to 254 separate characters.
Character Literals
(Single Characters)

A character literal, as shown in Figure 11-8, consists of a single character
only. That character is enclosed in single inverted commas (’).

Special formatting characters, the inverted comma ( ’ ) and the $ sign can be
entered using the character $. A string literal can contain any number of
breaks.
String Breaks

A string is located either on a single line of an SCL block or is spread over
several lines by means of special identifiers. The identifier ’$>’ is used to
break a string and the identifier ’$<’ to continue it on a subsequent line.
TEXT:STRING[20]:=’The FB$>//Preliminary version
$<converts’;
The space between the break and the continuation identifiers may extend
over a number of lines and can only contain comments or spaces. A string
literal can be broken and continued in this way (see also Figure 11-10) any
number of times.

Characters

In a character literal, you can also use all non-printing characters of the
extended ASCII character set. To do this, you specify the substitute
representation in hexadecimal code.
You type in an ASCII character in the form $hh, where hh represents the
value of the ASCII character in hexadecimal notation.
Example:

## 12.1 Overview


Global Data

In SCL you have the facility of accessing global data. There are two types of
global data as follows:

S CPU Memory Areas
These memory areas represent system data such as inputs, outputs and bit
memory (see Section 7.5). The number of memory areas available is
determined by your CPU.

S Global User Data in the form of Loadable Data Blocks
These data areas are contained within data blocks. In order to be able to
use them you must first have created the data blocks and declared the data
within them. In the case of instance data blocks, they are derived from
function blocks and automatically generated.

Types of Access

Global data can be accessed in the following ways:

S absolute: via address identifier and absolute address
S symbolic: via a symbol previously defined in the symbol table (see
/231/).

S indexed: via address identifier and array index
S structured: via a variable

## 12.2 CPU Memory Areas

Definition

CPU memory areas are system data areas. For this reason, you do not have to
declare them in your logic block.

Different Areas of
Memory

Each CPU provides the following memory areas together with a separate
address area for each:

S Inputs/outputs in the image memory
S Peripheral inputs/outputs
S Bit memory
S Timers, counters (see Chapter 17)
Syntax for Access

A CPU area is accessed by means of a value assignment in the code section
of a logic block (see Section 14.3) using either

S a simple accessing operation which can be specified in absolute or
symbolic terms, or

S an indexed accessing operation.

## 12.3 Absolute Access to CPU Memory Areas


Basic Principle

Absolute access to a memory area of the CPU is achieved by assigning an
absolute identifier to a variable of the same type.
STATUS_2:= IB10;
Absolute identifier
Variable of matching type

The absolute identifier indicates a memory area in the CPU. You specify this
area by specifying the address identifier (in this case IB) followed by the
address (in this case 10).
Absolute
Identifiers

The absolute identifier is made up of the address identifier, consisting of a
memory and a size prefix, and an address.
Size prefix
Memory prefix

Syntax of Memory Prefix

Depending on the language set in the SIMATIC Manager, either the SIMATIC or the IEC address identifiers have a
reserved meaning. You can set the language and the mnemonics separately in the SIMATIC Manager.


Declaring Global Data

Size Prefix

The size prefix is used to specify the length or the type of the memory area
(for example, a byte or a word) to be read from the peripheral I/Os. You can,
for example read a byte or a word. Using the size prefix is optional if only
one bit is specified. Figure 12-4 shows the syntax:
Size Prefix

B

D

Syntax of Size Prefix

When specifying an address depending on which size prefix you have used,
you specify an absolute address that identifies a specific bit, byte, word or
double word. Only if you have specified ”Bit” as the size can you specify an
additional bit address (see Figure 12-5). The first number refers to the byte
address and the second to the bit address.

**Example:**

Declaring Global Data


## 12.4 Symbolic Access to CPU Memory Areas


Basic Principle

When you program symbolically, instead of using the absolute address
consisting of address identifier and address, you use a symbolic name to
access a specific CPU memory area, as illustrated by the following examples:
Symbol

Absolute
Address

Data Type

Comments

Motor_contact

I 1.7

BOOL

Contact switch 1 for
Motor A 1

Status word

Input_byte1

IB 1

BYTE

Input byte

“Input 1.1”

I 1.1

BOOL

Photoelectric barrier

Meas_channels

MW 2

WORD

Meas. value buffer

The symbolic name is assigned to the address in your application program by
creating a symbol table.
For the data type specification, you can use any elementary data type
providing it can accept the specified data element size.

Accessing

You access a symbol, for example, by assigning a value to a variable of the
same type using the symbol declared.
MEASVAL_1

Creating the
Symbol Table

:= Motor_contact;

The symbol table is created and values entered in it using STEP 7.
You can open the symbol table by means of the SIMATIC Manager or in SCL
by selecting the menu command Options Symbol Table.
You can also import and edit symbol tables created with any text editor (for
details, refer to /231/).


**Examples:**

Below are some examples of symbolic access:

STATUSBYTE

:= Input_byte1;

STATUS_3

:= ”Input 1.1”;

Measval

:= Meas_channels;


**Example:**

Symbolic Access


Declaring Global Data


## 12.5 Indexed Access to CPU Memory Areas


Basic Principle

You can also access memory areas of the CPU using an index. Compared
with absolute addressing, the advantage of this method is that you can
address dynamically using variable indices. For example, you can use the
control variable of a FOR loop as the index.
Indexed access to a memory area is performed in a similar manner to the
absolute method. It differs only by virtue of the address specification. Instead
of the absolute address, an index is specified which can be a constant, a
variable or a mathematical expression.

Absolute Identifier

The absolute identifier in the case of indexed access is made up of the
address identifier and a basic expression for the indexing operation (as per
Section 12.3).
Size prefix
Memory prefix

E X [i,j]

Address identifier

Rules for Indexed
Access

Address
Basic expression for index
enclosed in square
brackets

Indexing must conform to the following rules:

S When accessing data of the types BYTE, WORD or DWORD, you must use
one index only. The index is interpreted as a byte address. The size of the
data unit accessed is specified by the size prefix.

S When accessing data of the type BOOL, you must use two indices. The
first index specifies the byte address, the second index the bit position
within the byte.

S Each index must be a mathematical expression of the data type INT.

MEASWORD_1

## 12.6 Data Blocks


Summary

Within data blocks, you can store and process all the data for your
application that is valid throughout the entire program or the entire project.
Every logic block can read or write data from/to a data block.

Declaration

The syntax for the structure of data blocks is explained in Chapter 8. You
should distinguish between two sorts of data block as follows:

S Data Blocks
S Instance data blocks
Accessing Data
Blocks

The data in any data block can always be accessed in any of the following
ways:

S Simple or absolute

## 12.7 Absolute Access to Data Blocks


Basic Principle

Absolute access to a data block is effected by assigning a value to a variable
of a matching type in the same way as for CPU memory areas. You first
specify the DB identifier followed by the keyword ”D” and the size prefix
(for example X for BIT) and the byte address (for example 13.1).
STATUS_5:= DB11.DX13.1;

additional bit address if you have used the size prefix ”bit”. The first number
represents the byte address and the second the bit address.

## 12.8 Indexed Access to Data Blocks


Indexed Access

You can also access global data blocks using an index. Compared with
absolute addressing, the advantage of this method is that by the use of
variable indices you can address data dynamically. For example, you can use
the control variable of a FOR loop as the index.
Indexed accessing of a data block is performed in a similar manner to
absolute accessing. It differs only by virtue of the address.
Instead of the address, an index is specified which can be a constant, a
variable or a mathematical expression.

Absolute Identifier

The absolute identifier in the case of indexed access is made up of the
address identifer (as per Section 12.7) and a basic indexing expression.
Memory prefix

Size prefix

DB identifier

D X [i,j]

Address
Basic indexing expression
enclosed in square brackets

Rules for Indexed
Access

When using indices, the following rules must be adhered to:

S Each index must be a mathematical expression of the data type INT.
S When accessing data of the types BYTE, WORD or DWORD, you must use
one index only. The index is interpreted as a byte address. The size of the
data unit accessed is specified by the size prefix.

S When accessing data of the type BOOL, you must use two indices. The
first index specifies the byte address, the second index the bit position
within the byte.

STATUS_1:= DB11.DW[COUNTER];
STATUS_2:= DB12.DW[WNUM, BITNUM];
STATUS_1:= Database1.DW[COUNTER];
STATUS_2:= Database2.DW[WNUM, BITNUM];
STATUS_1:= WORD_TO_BLOCK_DB(INDEX).DW[COUNTER];

**Example:**

Indexed Access


Declaring Global Data


## 12.9 Structured Access to Data Blocks


Basic Principle

Structured access is effected by assigning a value to a variable of a matching
type.
TIME_1:= DB11.TIME_OF_DAY ;
Simple variable
DB identifier
Variable of matching type

You identify the variable in the data block by specifying the DB name and
the name of the simple variable separated by a full stop. The required syntax
is detailed in Figure 12-6.
The simple variable stands for a variable to which you have assigned an
elemetary or a complex data type in the declaration.

**Examples:**

Declaration section of FB10:
VAR
Result:
STRUCT ERG1 : INT;
ERG2 : WORD;
END_STRUCT
END_VAR
User-defined data type UDT1:
TYPE UDT1
STRUCT ERG1 : INT;
ERG2 : WORD;
END_STRUCT
DB20 with user-defined data type:
DB20
UDT1
BEGIN ...
DB30 without user-defined data type:
DB30
STRUCT ERG1 : INT;
ERG2 : WORD;
END_STRUCT
BEGIN ...

**Example:**

Expressions, Operators and Addresses

Introduction

13

An expression stands for a value that is calculated during compilation or
when the program is running and consists of addresses (for example
constants, variables or function values) and operators (for example *, /, +
or –).
The data types of the addresses and the operators used determine the type of
expression. SCL distinguishes:

S mathematical expressions
S exponential expressions
S comparative expressions
S logical expressions

## 13.1 Operators

Overview

Expressions consist of operators and addresses. Most SCL operators link two
addresses and are therefore termed binary operators. The others work with
only one address and are thus called unary operators.
Binary operators are placed between the addresses as in the expression ‘A +
B’. A unary operator always immediately precedes its address as in the
expression ‘–B’.
The operator priority listed in Table 13-1 governs the order in which
calculations are performed. ‘1’ represents the highest priority.

## 13.2 Syntax of Expressions


Overview

Expressions can be illustrated using the syntax diagram in Figure 13-1.
Mathematical, logical and comparative expressions as well as exponential
expressions have a number of special characteristics and are therefore treated
individually in Sections 13.3 to 13.6.

Syntax of Expressions

You can perform the following operations on the result of an expression:

S Assign it to a variable.
S Use it as the condition for a control instruction.
S Use it as a parameter for calling a function or a function block.

Sequence of
Operations

The order in which the operations are performed is determined by:

S The priority of the operators involved
S The sequence from left to right
S The use of parentheses (if operators have the same priority).


Expressions, Operators and Addresses

Rules

Expressions are processed according to the following rules:

S An address between two operators of different priority is always attached
to the higher-priority operator.

S Operators with the same priority are processed from left to right.
S Placing a minus sign before an identifier is the same as multiplying it by
–1.

S Mathematical operators must not follow each other directly. The
expression a * – b is invalid, whereas a * (–b) is permitted.

S Parentheses can be used to overcome operator priority, in other words
parentheses have the highest priority.

S Expressions in parentheses are considered as a single address and always
processed first.

S The number of left parentheses must match the number of right
parentheses.

S Mathematical operators cannot be used with characters or logical data.
Expressions such as ‘A’ +‘B’ and (n<=0) + (n<0) are thus not permissible.

Expressions, Operators and Addresses

Rules

The order in which operators are applied within a mathematical expression is
based on their priority(see Table 13-2).

S It is advisable to place negative numbers in brackets for the sake of
clarity even in cases where it is not necessary from a mathematical point
of view.

S When dividing with two whole numbers of the type INT, the operators
“DIV” and “/” produce the same result (see example 13-3).

S The division operators ( ‘/’, ‘MOD’ and ‘DIV’ ) require that the second
address is not equal to zero.

S If one number is of the INT type (integer) and the other of the REAL type
(real number), the result will always be of the REAL type.


**Examples:**

The examples below illustrate the construction of mathematical expressions.
Let us assume that ‘i’ and ‘j’ are integer variables whose values are 11 and –3
respectively. Example 13-3 shows some integer expressions and their
corresponding values.
Expression
i + j
i – j
i * j
i DIV j
i MOD j
i/j


**Example:**

Mathematical Expressions

Let us assume that i and j are integer variables whose values are 3 and –5
respectively. In Example 13-4 the result of the mathematical expression
shown, (that is, the integer value 7) is assigned to the variable VALUE.

VALUE:= i + i * 4 / 2 - (7+i) / (-j) ;

## 13.5 Comparative Expressions


Definition

A comparative expression is an expression of the type BOOL formed with
comparative operators. These expressions are formed by combinations of
addresses of the same type or type class with the operators shown in
Table 13-7.
Comparative Operator
<

Figure 13-7

Comparisons

>

<=

>=

=

<>

Syntax of Comparative Operators

The comparative operators compare the numerical value of two addresses.
Address1 Operator Address2 ⇒ Boolean value
The result obtained is a value that represents either the attribute TRUE or
FALSE. The value is TRUE if the comparison condition is satisfied and
FALSE if it is not.

Rules

The following rules must be adhered to when creating comparative
expressions:

S Logical addresses should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure that the
order in which the logical operations are to be performed is unambiguous.

S Logical expressions can be linked according to the rules of Boolean logic
to create queries such as ”if a < b and b < c then ...”. Variables or
constants of the type BOOL and comparative expressions can be used as
the expression.

S Comparisons of all variables in the following type classes are permitted:
– INT, DINT, REAL
– BOOL, BYTE, WORD, DWORD
– CHAR, STRING

S With the following time types, only variables of the same type can be
compared:
– DATE, TIME, TOD, DT

S When comparing characters (type CHAR), the operation follows the order
of the ASCII character string.

S S5TIME variables can not be compared.
S If both addresses are of the type DT or STRING, you must use the
appropriate IEC functions to compare them.


Expressions, Operators and Addresses


**Examples:**

The examples below illustrate the construction of comparative expressions:
// The result of the comparative expression
// is negated.
IF NOT (COUNTER > 5) THEN... ;
//...
//...
END_IF;
// The result of the first comparative expression
// is negated and conjugated with the result
// of the second
A:= NOT (COUNTER1 = 4) AND (COUNTER2 = 10) ;

// Disjunction of two comparative expressions
WHILE (A >= 9) OR (QUERY <> ’n’) DO
//...
//...
END_WHILE;

## 13.6 Logical Expressions

Definition

A logical expression is an expression formed by logical operators. Using the
operators AND, &, XOR and OR, logical addesses (type BOOL) or variables of
the data type BYTE, WORD or DWORD can be combined to form logical
expressions. The operator NOT is used to negate (that is, reverse) the value of
a logical address.

Basic Logical Operator

NOT is not a basic operator
The operator acts like a mathematical sign.

A value assignment is used to assign the value of an expression to a variable.
The previous value of the variable is overwritten.

In SCL there are simple and structured instructions. As well as value
assignments, the simple instructions include operation calls and the GOTO
instruction. For more detailed information, refer to Chapters 15 and 16.
The control instructions for a program branching operation or loop
processing are structured instructions. A detailed explanation is given in
Chapter 15.


## Value Assignments


## 14.1 Overview


Basic Principle

A value assignment replaces the current value of a variable with a new value
specified by an expression. This expression can also contain identifiers for
functions that it activates and which return corresponding values (return
values).
As shown in syntax diagram 14-1, the expression on the right-hand side of
the assignment operator is evaluated and the value obtained as the result is
stored in the variable whose name is on the left-hand side of the assignment
operator. The variables permitted for this function are shown in Figure 14-1.

## Value Assignments


## 14.2 Value Assignments Using Variables of Elementary Data Types

Assignment

Any expression or variable of an elementary data type can be assigned to a
different variable of the same type.
Identifier := expression ;
Identifier := variable of an elementary data type ;


**Examples:**

The following are examples of valid value assignments:

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB10
VAR
SWITCH_1
:INT;
SWITCH_2
:INT;
SETPOINT_1 :REAL;
SETPOINT_2 :REAL;
QUERY_1

// Assigning an expression to a variable
SWITCH_2:= SWITCH_1 * 3;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Value Assignments Using Elementary Data Types


## Value Assignments


## 14.3 Value Assignments Using Variables of the Types STRUCT or UDT


STRUCT and UDT
Variables

Variables of the types STRUCT and UDT are structured variables which
represent either a complete structure or a component of that structure.
The following are examples of valid structure variables:

Image
Image.element

//Identifier for a structure
//Identifier for a structure
//component
Image.array
//Identifier for a single array
//within a structure
Image.array[2,5] //Identifier for an array component
//within a structure

Assigning a
Complete
Structure

An entire structure can only be assigned to another structure when the
structure components match each other both in terms of data type and name.
A valid assignment would be, for example:
structname_1:=structname_2;

Assigning
Structure
Components

You can assign any structure component a variable of the same type, an
expression of the same type or another structure component. The following
assignments would be valid:

structname_1.element1 := Value;
structname_1.element1 := 20.0;
structname_1.element1 := structname_2.element1;
structname_1.arrayname1 := structname_2.arrayname2;
structname_1.arrayname[10]:= 100;


## Value Assignments


**Examples:**

The following examples illustrate value assignments for structure data.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB10
VAR
AUXVAR: REAL;
MEASVALUE: STRUCT //destination structure
VOLTAGE:REAL;
RESISTANCE:REAL;
SIMPLE_ARRAY:ARRAY[1..2,1..2] OF INT;
END_STRUCT;
PROCVALUE: STRUCT
//source structure
VOLTAGE: REAL;
RESISTANCE: REAL;
SIMPLE_ARRAY:ARRAY[1..2,1..2] OF INT;
END_STRUCT
END_VAR
BEGIN
//Assigning a complete structure to
//a complete structure
MEASVALUE:= PROCVALUE;
//Assigning a structure component to a
//structure component
MEASVALUE.VOLTAGE:= PROCVALUE.VOLTAGE
// Assigning a structure component to a
// variable of the same type
AUXVAR:= PROCVALUE.RESISTANCE;
// Assigning a constant to a
// structure component
MEASVALUE.RESISTANCE:= 4.5;
// Assigning a constant to a simple array
MEASVALUE.SIMPLE_ARRAY[1,2]:= 4;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type STRUCT


## Value Assignments


## 14.4 Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type ARRAY


Array Variable

An array consists of one up to a maximum of six dimensions and contains
elements that are all of the same type. There are two ways of assigning arrays
to a variable as follows:
You can reference complete arrays or a component of an array. A complete
array can be referenced by specifying the variable name of the array.
arrayname_1
A single component of an array is addressed using the array name followed
by suitable index values in square brackets. An index is available for each
dimension. These are separated by commas and also enclosed in square
brackets. An index must be a mathematical expression of the data type INT.
arrayname_1[2]
arrayname_1[4,5]

Assigning a
Complete Array

A complete array can be assigned to another array when both the data types
of the components and the array limits (lowest and highest possible array
indices) match. A valid assignment would be as follows:
arrayname_1 := arrayname_2 ;

Assigning an
Array Component

A value assignment for a permissible array component is obtained by
omitting indices in the square brackets after the name of the array, starting on
the right. In this way, you address a subset of the array whose number of
dimensions is equal to the number of indices omitted.
This means that you can reference ranges of lines and individual components
of a matrix but not column ranges (that is, from ... to).
The following are examples of valid assignments
arrayname_1[ i ] := arrayname_2[ j ] ;
arrayname_1[ i ] := expression ;
identifier_1


:= arrayname_1[ i ] ;


## Value Assignments


**Examples:**

The examples below illustrate value assignments for arrays.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB3
VAR
SETPOINTS
:ARRAY [0..127] OF INT;
PROCVALUES :ARRAY [0..127] OF INT;
END_VAR
// Declaration of a matrix
// (=two-dimensional array)
// with 3 lines and 4 columns
CTRLLR: ARRAY [1..3, 1..4] OF INT;
// Declaration of a vector
// (=one-dimensional array)
// with 4 components
CTRLLR_1: ARRAY [1..4] OF INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
// Assigning a complete array to an array
SETPOINTS:= PROCVALUES;
// Assigning a vector to the second line
// of the CTRLLR ARRAY
CTRLLR[2]:= CTRLLR_1;
//Assigning a component of an array to a
//component of the CTRLLR ARRAY
CTRLLR [1,4]:= CTRLLR_1 [4];
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type ARRAY


## Value Assignments


## 14.5 Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type STRING


STRING Variables

A variable of the data type STRING contains a character string with a
maximum of 254 characters.

Assignment

Each variable of the data type STRING can be assigned another variable of
the same type. Valid assignments would be as follows:
stringvariable_1 := Stringliteral ;
stringvariable_1 := stringvariable_2 ;


**Example:**

The examples below illustrate value assignments using STRING variables:

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB3
VAR
DISPLAY_1
: STRING[50] ;
STRUCTURE1

: STRUCT
DISPLAY_2 : STRING[100] ;
DISPLAY_3 : STRING[50] ;

END_STRUCT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
// Assigning a constant to a STRING
// variable
DISPLAY_1 := ’error in module 1’ ;
// Assigning a structure component to a
// STRING variable.
DISPLAY_1 := STRUCTURE1.DISPLAY_3 ;
// Assigning a STRING variable to
// a STRING variable
If DISPLAY_1 <> DISPLAY_3 THEN
DISPLAY_1 := DISPLAY_3 ;
END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK


**Example:**

Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type STRING


## Value Assignments


## 14.6 Value Assignments Using Variables of the Type DATE_AND_TIME


DATE_AND_TIME
Variables

The data type DATE_AND_TIME defines an area with 64 bits (8 bytes) for
the date and time.

Assignment

Each variable of the data type DATE_AND_TIME can be assigned another
variable of the same type or a constant. Valid assignments would be as
follows:
dtvariable_1 := date and time literal ;
dtvariable_1 := dtvariable_2 ;


**Example:**

The examples below illustrate value assignments using DATE_AND_TIME
variables:

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB3
VAR
TIME_1
: DATE_AND_TIME;
STRUCTURE1 : STRUCT
TIME_2 : DATE_AND_TIME ;
TIME_3 : DATE_AND_TIME ;
END_STRUCT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
// Assigning a constant to a
// DATE_AND_TIME variable
TIME_1 := DATE_AND_TIME#1995–01–01–12:12:12.2 ;
STRUCTURE.TIME_3 := DT#1995–02–02–11:11:11 ;
// Assigning a structure component to a
// DATE_AND_TIME variable.
TIME_1 := STRUCTURE1.TIME_2 ;
// Assigning a DATE_AND_TIME variable
// to a DATE_AND_TIME structure component
If TIME_1 < STRUCTURE1.TIME_3 THEN
TIME_1 := STRUCTURE3.TIME_1 ;
END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Value Assignments Using DATE_AND_TIME Variables

## 14.7 Value Assignments using Absolute Variables for Memory Areas


Absolute Variables

An absolute variable references the globally valid memory areas of a CPU.
You can assign values to these areas in three ways as described in Chapter
12.

Syntax of Absolute Variables

Assignment

Any absolute variable with the exception of peripheral inputs and process
image inputs can be assigned a variable or expression of the same type.


**Example:**

The examples below illustrate value assignments using absolute variables:

VAR
STATUSWORD1: WORD;
STATUSWORD2: BOOL;
STATUSWORD3: BYTE;
STATUSWORD4: BOOL;
ADDRESS: INT:= 10;
END_VAR
BEGIN
// Assigning an input word to a
// variable (simple access)
STATUSWORD1:= IW4 ;
// Assigning a variable to an
// output bit (simple access)
STATUSWORD2:= Q1.1 ;
// Assigning an input byte to a
// variable (indexed access)
STATUSWORD3:= IB[ADDRESS];
// Assigning an input bit to a
// variable (indexed access)
FOR ADDRESS:= 0 TO 7 BY 1 DO
STATUSWORD4:= I[1,ADDRESS] ;
END_FOR;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

## 14.8 Value Assignments using Global Variables


Variables in DBs

You can also access global variables in data blocks by assigning a value to
variables of the same type or vice-versa. You have the option of using
structured, absolute or indexed access (see Chapter 12).

Syntax of DB Variables

You can assign any global variable a variable or expression of the same type.
The following are examples of valid assignments:
DB11.DW10:=20;
DB11.DW10:=Status;


**Examples:**

The example below assumes that that a variable ”DIGIT” of the data type
INTEGER and a structure ”DIGIT1” with the component ”DIGIT2” of the
type INTEGER have been declared in the data block DB11.

// Required data block DB11
DATA_BLOCK DB11

## Control Statements


Introduction

Chapter
Overview

Only on rare occasions is it possible to program blocks in such a way that all
statements are processed one after the other from the beginning to the end of
the block. It is usually the case that on the basis of specific conditions only
certain statements (alternatives) are executed or are repeated a number of
times over (loops). The programming tools used to bring about such effects
are the control statements in an SCL block.

## 15.1 Overview


Selective
Instructions

In programs, different instructions often have to be executed according to
different conditions. A selective instruction enables you to direct the program
progression into any number of alternative sequences of instructions.
Table 15-1

Repetition
Instructions

Function

IF Statement

The IF statement enables you to direct the program progression
into one of two alternative branches according to whether a
specified condition is either TRUE of FALSE:

CASE
Statement

The CASE statement enables you direct the program progression
into 1 of n alternative branches by having a variable adopt a value
from n alternatives.

You can control loop processing by means of repetition instructions. A
repetition instruction specifies which parts of a program should be repeated
on the basis of specific conditions.

Jump Statements

FOR
Statement

Used to repeat a sequence of statements for as long as the control
variable remains within the specified value range

WHILE
Statement

Used to repeat a sequence of statements while an execution
condition continues to be satisfied

REPEAT
Statement

Used to repeat a sequence of statements until a break condition is
met

A jump statement causes the program to jump immediately to a specified
jump destination and therefore to a different statement within the same block.

EXIT
Statement

Used to exit from a loop at any point regardless of whether the
break condition is satisfied or not

GOTO
Statement

Causes the program to jump immediately to a specified jump label

RETURN
Statement

Causes the program to exit the block currently being processed


## Control Statements


Conditions

A condition is either a comparative expression or a logical expression. The
data type of a condition is BOOL and it can adopt either of the two values
TRUE or FAlSE.
The following are examples of valid comparative expressions:
COUNTER<=100
SQR(A)>0.005
Answer = 0
BALANCE>=BALBFWD
ch1< ’T’

The following are examples of the use of comparative expressions with
logical operators:
(COUNTER<=100) AND(CH1<’*’)
(BALANCE<100.0) OR (STATUS =’R’)
(Answer<0)OR((Answer>5.0) AND (Answer<10.0))

Note
Note that the logical addresses (in this case comparative expressions) are in
brackets in order to prevent any ambiguity with regard to the order in which
they are processed.


## Control Statements


## 15.2 IF Statement


Basic Principle

The IF statement is a conditional statement. It provides one or more options
and selects one (or none) of its statement components for execution.

END_IF

Syntax of the IF Statement

Execution of the conditional statement forces analysis of the specified logical
expressions. If the value of an expression is TRUE then the condition is
satisfied, if it is FALSE the condition is not satisfied.
Execution

An IF statement is processed according to the following rules:
1. If the value of the first expression is TRUE, the component of the
   statement which follows THEN is executed. Otherwise the statements in
   the ELSIF branches are processed.
2. If no Boolean expression in the ELSIF branches is TRUE, the sequence
   of statements following ELSE (or no sequence of statements if there is no
   ELSE branch) is executed.
   Any number of ELSIF statements can be used.
   It should be noted that the ELSIF branches and/or the ELSE branch can be
   omitted. In such cases, the program behaves as if those branches were present
   but contained no statements.
   Note
   Note that the statement END_IF must be concluded with a semicolon.


## Control Statements


Note
Using one or more ELSIF branches has the advantage that the logical
expressions following a valid expression are no longer evaluated in contrast
to a sequence of IF statements. The runtime of a program can therefore be
reduced.


**Example:**

Example 15-1 below illustrates the use of the IF statement.
IF I1.1 THEN
N:= 0;
SUM:= 0;
OK:= FALSE; // Set OK flag to FALSE
ELSIF START = TRUE THEN
N:= N + 1;
SUM:= SUM + N;
ELSE
OK:= FALSE;
END_IF;


**Example:**

```scl
IF Statements
```


## Control Statements


## 15.3 CASE Statement


Basic Principle

The CASE statement selects one program section from a choice of n
alternatives. That choice is based on the current value of a selection
expression.

END_CASE

Syntax of the CASE Statement

The CASE statement is processed according to the following rules:
1. When a CASE statement is processed, the program checks whether the
   value of the selection expression is contained within a specified list of
   values. Each value in that list represents one of the permissible values for
   the selection expression. The selection expression must return a value of
   the type INTEGER.
2. If a match is found, the statement component assigned to the list is
   executed.
3. The ELSE branch is optional: it is executed if no match is found.
   Note
   Note that the statement END_CASE must be concluded with a semicolon.


## Control Statements

Rules

Syntax of Value List

When creating the value list you must observe the following rules:

S Each value list must begin with a constant, a list of constants or a range of
constants.

S The values within the value list must be of the INTEGER type.
S Each value must only occur once.

**Examples:**

Example 15-2 below illustrates the use of the CASE statement. The variable
TW is usually of the INTEGER type.
CASE TW OF
1:
2:
3:

DISPLAY
:= OVEN_TEMP;
DISPLAY
:= MOTOR_SPEED;
DISPLAY
:= GROSS_TARE;
QW4 := 16#0003;
4..10:DISPLAY
:= INT_TO_DINT (TW);
QW4 := 16#0004;
11,13,19:DISPLAY:= 99;
QW4 := 16#0005;
ELSE:
DISPLAY
:= 0;
TW_ERROR := 1;
END_CASE;

**Example:**

```scl
CASE Statement
```

Note
Take care to ensure that the running time of loops is not too long, otherwise
the CPU will register a time-out error and switch to STOP mode.


## Control Statements


## 15.4 FOR Statement

Basic Principle

A FOR statement is used to repeat a sequence of statements in a loop while a
variable (the control variable) is continually assigned values. The control
variable must be the identifier of a local variable of the type INT or DINT.
FOR Statement

END_FOR

Figure 15-4

Syntax of FOR Statement

The definition of a loop using FOR includes the specification of an initial and
a final value. Both values must be the same type as the control variable.

Execution

The FOR statement is processed according to the following rules:
1. At the start of the loop, the control variable is set to the initial value
   (initial assignment) and each time the loop is run through it is increased
   (positive increment) or decreased (negative increment) by the specified
   increment until the final value is reached.
2. Following each run through of the loop, the condition
   |initial value | <= |final value|
   is checked to establish whether or not it is satisfied. If the condition is
   satisfied, the sequence of statements is executed, otherwise the loop and
   thereby the sequence of statements is skipped.
   Note
   Note that the statement END_FOR must be concluded with a semicolon.


## Control Statements


Initial Assignment

The initial assignment shown in Figure 15-5 can be used to create the initial
value of the control variable.

Syntax for Creating the Initial Value

Examples:
FOR I

:= 1 TO 20

FOR I

:= 1 TO (Init+J) DO

Final Value and
Increment

You can create a basic expression for creating the final value and the required
increment.

Rules

The following rules must be observed for the FOR statement:

S You can omit the statement BY [increment]. If no increment is
specified, it is automatically assumed to be +1.

S Initial value, final value and increment are expressions (see Chapter 13).
They are processed once only at the start of execution of the FOR
statement.

S Alteration of the values for final value and increment is not permissible
while the loop is being processed.


**Example:**

Example 15-3 below illustrates the use of the FOR statement.

FUNCTION_BLOCK SEARCH
VAR
INDEX
: INT;
KEYWORD
: ARRAY [1..50] OF STRING;
END_VAR
BEGIN
FOR INDEX:= 1 TO 50 BY 2 DO
IF KEYWORD [INDEX] = ’KEY’ THEN
EXIT;
END_IF;
END_FOR;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

```scl
FOR Statement
```


## Control Statements


## 15.5 WHILE Statement


Basic Principle

The WHILE statement allows the repeated execution of a sequence of
statements on the basis of an execution condition. The execution condition is
formed according to the rules of a logical expression.
WHILE Statement
Expression

WHILE

DO

Code
section

END_WHILE

Execution condition

Figure 15-6

Syntax of the WHILE Statement

The statement component which follows DO is repeated as long as the value
of the execution condition remains TRUE.

Execution

The WHILE statement is processed according to the following rules:
1. The execution condition is checked before each execution of the
   statement component.
2. If the value TRUE is returned, the statement component is executed.
3. If the value FALSE is returned, execution of the WHILE statement is
   terminated. It is possible for this to occur on the very first occasion the
   execution condition is checked.
   Note
   Note that the statement END_WHILE must be concluded with a semicolon.


**Example:**

Example 15-4 below illustrates the use of the WHILE statement.
FUNCTION_BLOCK SEARCH
VAR
INDEX
: INT;
KEYWORD
: ARRAY [1..50] OF STRING;
END_VAR
BEGIN
INDEX:= 1;
WHILE INDEX <= 50 AND KEYWORD[INDEX] <> ’KEY’ DO
INDEX:= INDEX + 2;
END_WHILE;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

```scl
WHILE Statement
```


## Control Statements


## 15.6 REPEAT Statement


Basic Principle

A REPEAT statement causes the repeated execution of a sequence of
statements between REPEAT and UNTIL until a break condition occurs. The
break condition is formed according to the rules of a logical expression.
REPEAT Statement

REPEAT

Code
section

UNTIL

Expression

END_REPEAT

Break condition

Figure 15-7

Syntax of the REPEAT Statement

The condition is checked after the loop has been executed. This means that
the loop must be executed at least once even if the break condition is
satisfied when the loop is started.
Note
Note that the statement END_REPEAT must be concluded with a semicolon.


**Example:**

Example 15-5 below illustrates the use of the REPEAT statement
FUNCTION_BLOCK SEARCH
VAR
INDEX
: INT;
KEYWORD
: ARRAY [1..50] OF STRING;
END_VAR
BEGIN
INDEX:= 0;
REPEAT
INDEX:= INDEX + 2;
UNTIL
INDEX > 50 OR KEYWORD[INDEX] = ’KEY’
END_REPEAT;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

```scl
REPEAT Statement
```


## Control Statements


## 15.7 CONTINUE Statement


Basic Principle

A CONTINUE statement is used to terminate the execution of the current
iteration of a loop (initiated by a FOR, WHILE or REPEAT statement) and to
restart processing within the loop.
CONTINUE Statement
CONTINUE

Figure 15-8

Syntax of the CONTINUE Statement

In a WHILE loop, the initial condition determines whether the sequence of
statements is repeated and in a REPEAT loop the terminal condition.
In a FOR statement, the control variable is increased by the specified
increment immediately after a CONTINUE statement.


**Example:**

Example 15-6 below illustrates the use of the CONTINUE statement.
FUNCTION_BLOCK_CONTINUE
VAR
INDEX :INT;
ARRAY_1:ARRAY[1..100] OF INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
INDEX:= 0;
WHILE INDEX <= 100 DO
INDEX:= INDEX + 1;
// If ARRAY_1[INDEX] equals INDEX,
// then ARRAY_1 [INDEX] is not altered:
IF ARRAY_1[INDEX] = INDEX THEN
CONTINUE;
END_IF;
ARRAY_1[INDEX]:= 0;
// Other statements..
//....
END_WHILE;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

CONTINUE Statement


## Control Statements


## 15.8 EXIT Statement


Basic Principle

An EXIT statement is used to exit a loop (FOR, WHILE or REPEAT loop) at
any point regardless of whether the break condition is satisfied.
EXIT Statement
EXIT

Figure 15-9

Syntax of the EXIT Statement

This statement causes the repetition statement immediately surrounding the
exit statement to be exited immediately.
Execution of the program is continued after the end of the loop (for example
after END_FOR).


**Example:**

Example 15-7 below illustrates the use of the EXIT statement.
FUNCTION_BLOCK_EXIT
VAR
INDEX_1
:= INT;
INDEX_2
:= INT;
INDEX_SEARCH:= INT;
KEYWORD
: ARRAY[1..51] OF STRING;
END_VAR
BEGIN
INDEX_2
:= 0;
FOR INDEX_1:= 1 TO 51 BY 2 DO
// Exit the FOR loop if
// KEYWORD[INDEX_1] equals ’KEY’:
IF KEYWORD[INDEX_1] = ’KEY’ THEN
INDEX_2:= INDEX_1;
EXIT;
END_IF;
END_FOR;
// The following value assignment is executed
// after execution of EXIT or after the
// normal termination of the FOR loop
INDEX_SEARCH:= INDEX_2;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

EXIT Statement


## Control Statements


## 15.9 GOTO Statement


Basic Principle

The GOTO statement is used to implement a program jump. It effects an
immediate jump to the specified jump label and therefore to a different
statement within the same block.
GOTO statements should only be used in special circumstances; for example,
for error handling. According to the rules of structured programming, the
GOTO statement should not be used.

GOTO Statement
GOTO

IDENTIFIER
Jump label

Figure 15-10

Syntax of the GOTO Statement

Jump label refers to a marker in the LABEL / END_LABEL declaration
subsection. That marker precedes the statement which is to be next executed
after the GOTO statement.

Rules

The following rules should be observed when using the GOTO statement:

S The destination of a GOTO statement must be within the same block.
S The destination of the jump must be unambiguous.
S Jumping to a loop is not permitted. Jumping from a loop is possible.


## Control Statements


**Example:**

Example 15-8 below illustrates the use of the GOTO statement.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB3//GOTO_BSP
VAR
INDEX : INT;
A
: INT;
B
: INT;
C
: INT;
KEYWORD: ARRAY[1..51] OF STRING;
END_VAR
LABEL
LABEL1, LABEL2, LABEL3;
END_LABEL
BEGIN
IF A > B THEN GOTO LABEL1;
ELSIF A > C THEN GOTO LABEL2;
END_IF;
//...
LABEL1
:
INDEX:= 1;
GOTO LABEL3;
LABEL2
:
INDEX:= 2;
//...
LABEL3
:
;
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK


**Example:**

GOTO Jump Statement


## Control Statements


## 15.10 RETURN Statement


Basic Principle

A RETURN statement causes the program to exit the block (OB, FB or FC)
currently being processed and to return to the calling block or the operating
system if the block being exited is an OB.
RETURN Instruction
RETURN

Figure 15-11

Syntax of the RETURN Statement

Note
A RETURN statement at the end of the code section of a logic block or the
declaration section of a data block is redundant, since the operation is
performed automatically at those points.


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Introduction

An SCL block can call the following:

S Other functions (FCs) and function blocks (FBs) created in SCL
S Functions and function blocks programmed in another STEP 7 language
(for example, Statement List or Ladder Logic)

S System functions (SFCs) and system function blocks (SFBs) in the
operating system of the CPU you are using.

Calling Functions and Function Blocks


## 16.1 Calling and Transferring Parameters

Parameter Transfer

When functions or function blocks are called, data is exchanged between the
calling and the called block. The parameters that are to be transferred must
be specified in the function call in the form of a parameter list. The
parameters are enclosed in brackets. A number of parameters are separated
by commas.

Basic Principle

In the example of a function call below, an input parameter, an in/out
parameter and an output parameter are specified.

Parameter list

Figure 16-1

Basic Principle of Parameter Transfer

As is shown in Figure 16-2, specification of parameters takes the form of a
value assignment. That value assignment assigns a value (actual parameter)
to the parameters defined in the declaration section of the called block
(formal parameters).

The formal parameters are those parameters expected by the block when
invoked. They are merely “placeholders” for the actual parameters that are
transferred to the block when called. Those parameters have been defined in
the declaration section of a block (FB or FC).

## 16.2 Calling Function Blocks (FB or SFB)


Global and Local
Instance

When you call a function block in SCL you can use

S Global instance data blocks, and
S Local instance areas of the active instance data block.
Calling an FB as a local instance differs from calling it as a global instance
by virtue of the way in which the data is stored. In this case, the data is not
stored in a special DB but is nested in the instance data block of the calling
FB.

Syntax of an FB Call

The function call is made in a call instruction by specifying the following:

S the name of the function block or system function block (FB or SFB
identifier),

S the instance data block (DB identifier),
S the parameter assignment (FB parameters)
A function call for a global instance can be either absolute or symbolic.
Absolute function call:
FB10.DB20 (X1:=5,X2:=78,......);
Parameter assignment

Symbolic function call:
DRIVE.ON (X1:=5,X2:=78,......);

Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Calling as Local
Instance

The function call is made in a call instruction by specifying the following:

S the local instance name (IDENTIFIER),
S the parameter assignment (FB parameters).
A function call for a local instance is always symbolic, for example:

MOTOR (X1:=5,X2:=78,......);
Parameter assignment

Calling a Local Instance


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

16.2.1

FB Parameters

Basic Principle

When calling a function block – as a global or local instance – you must
make a distinction in the parameter list between

S the input parameters and
S the in/out parameters
of an FB. In both cases, you use value assignments to assign the actual
parameters to the formal parameters as illustrated below:

**Example:**

Syntax of FB Parameters

A function call involving assignment of one input and one in/out parameter
might be as follows:

Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Rules

The rules for assigning parameter values are as follows:

S The assignments can be in any order.
S Individual assignments are separated by commas.
S The data type of formal and actual parameters must match.
S Output assignments are not possible in FB calls. The value of a declared
output parameter is stored in the instance data. From there it can be
accessed by all FBs. To read an output parameter, you must define the
access from within an FB (see Section 14.8).

Results of

## Function Call


When the block has been run through once:

S The actual parameters transferred are unchanged.
S The transferred and altered values of the in/out parameters have been
updated; in/out parameters of an elementary data type are an exception to
this rule (see Section 16.2.3).

S The output parameters can be read by the calling block from the global
instance area or the local instance area. For more precise details, refer to
Example 16-3.


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

16.2.2

Input Assignment (FB)

Basic Principle

Input assignments are used to assign actual parameters to the formal input
parameters. The FB cannot change these actual parameters. The assignment
of actual input parameters is optional. If no actual parameter is specified, the
values of the last call are retained.

TIMER/COUNTER
Identifier

BLOCK Identifier

Defines a specific block to be used as an input parameter. The
block type (FB, FC or DB) is specified in the input parameter
declaration.
When assigning parameter values you specify the block
number. You can use either the absolute or symbolic number
(see also Chapter 9).


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

16.2.3

In/Out Assignment (FB)

Basic Principle

In/out assignments are used to assign actual parameters to the formal in/out
parameters of the FB that has been called.
In contrast to input parameters, the called FB can change the in/out
parameters. The new value of a parameter that results from processing the FB
is written back to the actual parameters. The original value is overwritten.
If in/out parameters are declared in the called FB, they must be assigned
values the first time the block is called. After that, the specification of actual
parameters is optional.

Syntax of an In/out Assignment

Since the actual parameter assigned can be altered when the FB is processed
as it is an in/out parameter, it has to be a variable. For that reason, input
parameters can not be assigned by means of in/out assignments (the new
value would not be capable of being written back).

The following types of extended variable are possible:

Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Special
Considerations

Note the following special considerations:

S When the block is processed, the altered value of the in/out parameter is
updated. In/out parameters of an elementary data type are an exception
to this rule. In the latter case, an update is only performed if an actual
parameter is specified in the function call.

S The following can not be used as actual parameters for an in/out
parameter of a non elementary data type:
– FB in/out parameters
– FC parameters

S ANY parameters: the aforesaid applies in this case, too. In addition,
constants are not permissible as actual parameters.

Example of Calling a Global Instance

Basic Principle

An example of a function block with a FOR loop is shown in Example 16-1.
The examples given assume that the symbol TEST has been declared in the
symbol table for FB17.

END_FOR;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
Example 16-1

Calling

Example of an FB

To call the FB, you can choose one of the following options. It is assumed
that VARIABLE1 has been declared in the calling block as a REAL variable.
//Absolute function call, global instance:

//Symbolic function call; global instance:
TEST.TEST_1 (FINALVAL:= 10, IQ1:= VARIABLE1) ;

The two examples below illustrate the two possible ways of reading the
output parameter CONTROL.

//The output parameter is

Example 16-1 illustrates how a function block with a simple FOR loop could
be programmed assuming that the symbol TEST has been declared in the
symbol table for FB17.

This FB can be invoked as shown below, assuming that VARIABLE1 has
been declared in the invoking block as a REAL variable.
// Call local instance:
TEST_L (FINALVAL:= 10, IQ1:= VARIABLE1) ;

Example of FB Call as Local Instance

TEST_L must have been declared in the variable declaration as follows:

## 16.3 Calling Functions

Return Value

In contrast to function blocks, functions always return a result known as the
return value. For this reason, functions can be treated as addresses. Functions
with a return value of the type VOID are an exception to this rule.
In the following value assignment, for example, the function DISTANCE is
called with specific parameters:
LENGTH:= DISTANCE (X1:=–3, Y1:=2);
Return value is DISTANCE!
The function calculates the return value, which has the same name as the
function, and returns it to the calling block. There, the value replaces the
function call.
The return value can be used in the following elements of an FC or FB:

S a value assignment,
S a logical, mathematical or comparative expression or
S as a parameter for a further function block/function call.
Functions of the type VOID are an exception. They have no return value and
can therefore not be used in expressions.

Syntax of Function Call


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Note
If a function is called in SCL whose return value was not supplied, this can
lead to incorrect execution of the user program.
In an SCL function, this situation can occur when the return value was
supplied but the corresponding statement is not executed.
In an STL/LAD/FBD function, this situation can occur when the function
was programmed without supplying the return value or the corresponding
statement is not executed.

Calling

A function is called by specifying:

S the function name (FC IDENTIFIER, SFC IDENTIFIER, IDENTIFIER)
S the parameter list.

**Example:**

The function name which identifies the return value can be specified in
absolute or symbolic terms as shown in the following examples:
FC31
DISTANCE

Results of the

## Function Call


(X1:=5, Q1:= Digitsum)
(X1:=5, Q1:= Digitsum)

The results of a function call are available after execution of the call in the
form of

S a return value or
S output or in/out parameters (actual parameters)
For more detailed information on this subject, refer to Chapter 18.

16.3.1

FC Parameters

Basic Principle

In contrast to function blocks, functions do not have any memory in which to
store the values of parameters. Local data is only stored temporarily while
the function is active. For this reason, all formal input, in/out and output
parameters defined in the declaration section of a function must be assigned
actual parameters as part of the function call.

The example below illustrates a function call involving assignment of an
input parameter, an output parameter and an in/out parameter.

O_Param1:=Digitsum)

Rules

The rules for assigning values to parameters are as follows:

S The value assignments can be in any order.
S The data type of the formal and actual parameter in each case must
match.

S The individual assignments must be separated by commas.

16.3.2

Input Assignment (FC)

Basic Principle

Input assignments assign values (actual parameters) to the formal input
parameters of the called FC. The FC can work with these actual parameters
but cannot change them. In contrast to an FB call, this assignment is not
optional with an FC call. Input assignments have the follwing syntax:

Identifier

Defines a specific timer or counter to be used when a block is
processed (see also Chapter 17).

BLOCK
Identifier

Defines a specific block to be used as an input parameter. The
block type (FB, FC or DB) is specified in the declaration of
the input parameter. When assigning parameters, you specify
the block address. You can use either the absolute or the
symbolic address (see also Chapter 9).

Note that FB in/out parameters and FC parameters are not permissible as
actual parameters for formal FC input parameters of a non-elementary data
type.


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

16.3.3

Output and In/Out Assignment (FC)

Basic Principle

In an output assignment, you specify where the output values resulting from
processing a function are to be written to. An in/out assignment is used to
assign an actual value to an in/out parameter.
Figure 16-13 below shows the syntax of output and in/out assignments.

Syntax of Output and In/Out Assignments

The actual parameters in output and in/out assignments must be variables
since the FC writes values to the parameters. For this reason, input
parameters can not be assigned in in/out assignments (the value could not be
written).
Thus, only extended variables can be assigned in output and in/out
assignments.
Table 16-5

The following types of extended variable can be used:

Function calls (see also Chapter 14).


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Special
Considerations

Note the following special considerations:

S After the block is processed, the altered value of the in/out parameter is
updated.

S The following are not permitted as actual parameters for in/out
parameters of a non elemenatary data type:
– FB input parameters
– FB in/out parameters and
– FC parameters

S ANY parameters: The first point made above also applies here. The
following are not permitted as actual parameters for in/out parameters of
a non elemenatary data type:
– FB input parameters
– FC input parameters
In addition, constants are not permitted as actual parameters.
If the ANY type is declared as a function result (return value), the
following also applies:
– All ANY parameters must be supplied with addresses whose data
types are within a type class. By type class is meant the number of
numerical data types (INT, DNIT, REAL) or the number of bit data
types (BOOL, BYTE, WORD, DWORD) is meant. The other data
types each make up their own type class.
– The SCL Compiler assumes that the data type of the current function
result will be given as the highest-level type among the actual
parameters which are assigned to the ANY parameters.
With the function result, all operations are permitted which are
defined for this data type.

S POINTER-parameter: The first point made above also applies here. The
following are not permitted as actual parameters for in/out parameters of
a non elemenatary data type:
– FB input parameters
– FC input parameters

Example of a Function Call

Basic Principle

A function DISTANCE for calculating the distance between two points
(X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) in the same plane using the Cartesian system of
co-ordinates might take the following form (the examples assume that the
symbol DISTANCE has been declared in a symbol table for FC37).

value:

In a value assignment, for example

## 16.4 Implicitly Defined Parameters

Overview

Implicitly defined parameters are parameters that you can use without having
to declare them first in a block. SCL provides the following implicitly
defined parameters:

S the input parameter EN and
S the output parameter ENO
Both parameters are of the data type BOOL and are stored in the temporary
block data area.
Input Parameter
EN

Every function block and every function has the implicitly defined input
parameter EN. If EN is TRUE, the called block is executed. Otherwise it is
not executed. Supplying a value for the parameter EN is optional.
Remember, however, that EN must not be declared in the declaration section
of a block or function.
Since EN is an input parameter, you cannot change EN within a block.
Note
The return value of a function is not defined if the function is not called
because EN:=FALSE.


**Example:**

The following example illustrates the use of the parameter EN:
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB57
VAR
RESULT
: REAL;
MY_ENABLE
: BOOL;
END_VAR
...

BEGIN
MY_ENABLE:= FALSE;
// Function call
// in which the parameter EN is assigned a value:
RESULT:= FC85 (EN:= MY_ENABLE, PAR_1:= 27);
// FC85 not executed because MY_ENABLE
// is set to FALSE
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
Example 16-8


Use of EN


Calling Functions and Function Blocks

Output Parameter
ENO

Every function block and every function has the implicitly defined output
parameter ENO which is of the data type BOOL. When the execution of a
block is completed, the current value of the OK variable is set in ENO.
Immediately after a block has been called you can check the value of ENO to
see whether all the operations in the block ran correctly or whether errors
occurred.


**Example:**

The following example illustrates the use of the parameter EN0:
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB57
//...
//...
BEGIN
// Function block call:
FB30.DB30 (X1:=10, X2:=10.5);
// Check to see if all
// operations performed properly:
IF ENO THEN
// Everything OK
//...
ELSE
// Error occurred,
// therefore error handling
//...
END_IF;
//...
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
Example 16-9


**Example:**

Use of ENO

The following example shows the combination of EN and ENO:

// EN and ENO can also be combined
// as shown here:
FB30.DB30(X1:=10, X2:=10.5);
// The following function is only
// to be executed if FB30 is
// processed without errors
RESULT:= FC85 (EN:= ENO, PAR_1:= 27);

## 17.1 Counter Functions


Overview

STEP 7 provides a series of standard counter functions. You can use these
counters in your SCL program without needing to declare them previously.
You must simply supply them with the required parameters. STEP 7 provides
the following counter functions:

S Counter Up
S Counter Down
S Counter Up/Down
Calling

Counter functions are called just like functions. The function identifier can
therefore be used as an address in an expression provided you make sure that
the data type of the function result is compatible with the address replaced.

## Function Call

Parameters

The function call parameters for all three counter functions are listed in Table

```

Calling a Counter Down Function


## Counters and Timers


Calling
Dynamically

Instead of the absolute counter number (for example,C_NO=C10), you can
also specify a variable of the data type COUNTER to call the function. The
advantage of this method is that the counter function call can be made
dynamic by assigning that variable a different absolute number in each
function call.
Example:
Function_Block COUNTER;
Var_Input
MyCounter: Counter;
End_Var
:
currVAL:=S_CD (C_NO:=MyCounter,........);

Rules

Since the parameter values (for example, CD:=I.0) are stored globally, under
certain circumstances specifying those parameters is optional. The following
general rules should be observed when supplying parameters with values:

S The parameter for the counter identifier C_NO must always be assigned a
value when the function is called.

S Either the parameter CU (up counter) or the parameter CD (down
counter) must be assigned a value, depending on the counter function
required.

S The parameters PV (initialization value) and S (set) can be omitted as a
pair.

S The result value in BCD format is always the function value.
Note
The names of the functions and parameters are the same in both SIMATIC
und IEC mnemonics. Only the counter identifier is mnemonic-dependent,
thus: SIMATIC: Z and IEC: C

Input and Evaluation of the Counter Reading

Overview

To input the initialization value or to evaluate the result of the function, you
require the internal representation of the counter reading (see Figure 17-1).
When you set the counter (parameter S), the value you specify is written to
the counter. The range of values is between 0 and 999. You can change the
counter reading within this range by specifying the operations count up/down
or count up and down

Explanation

Counter up

The counter reading is increased by ”1” when the signal status at input
CU changes from ”0” to ”1” and the count value is less than 999.

Set counter

When the signal status at input S changes from ”0” to ”1”, the counter
is set to the value of input PV. Such a signal change is always required
to set a counter.

Reset

The counter is reset when input R = 1 is set. Resetting the counter sets
the counter reading to ”0”.

Query

## 17.2 Timer Functions


Overview

Timers are functional elements in your program that perform and monitor
timed processes. STEP 7 provides a series of standard timer functions which
you can access using SCL. You can use timer operations to

S set delay periods
S enable monitoring periods
S generate pulses
S measure times
Calling

Timer functions are called in the same way as counter functions. The
function identifier can be used in any expression in place of an address
provided the data type of the function result is compatible with that of the
address replaced.

## Counters and Timers


Calling
Dynamically

Instead of the absolute timer number (for example, T10), you can also
specify a variable of the data type TIMER in the function call. The advantage
of this is that the timer function call is made dynamic by assigning that
variable a different absolute number in every function call.
Example:
FUNCTION_BLOCK TIMERUNIT
VAR_INPUT
MyTimer: timer;
END_VAR
:
currTime:=S_ODT (T_NO:=MyTimer,.........)

Rules

Since the parameter values are stored globally, under certain circumstances
specifying those values is optional. The following general rules should be
observed when assigning values to parameters:

S The parameter for the timer identifier T_NO must be assigned a value in
symbolic or absolute form in the function call.

S The parameters TV (initialization value) and S (set) can be omitted as a
pair.

S Reading of parameter values is optional. You can access Q and BI by
means of a value assignment.

S The result in S5TIME format is always the function value.
Note
The names of the functions are the same in both SIMATIC and IEC
mnemonics.

Input and Evaluation of the Timer Reading

Overview

To input the initialization value and to evaluate the function result in BCD
code, you require the internal representation of the timer reading (see Figure
17-2).
Updating the time decreases the timer reading by 1 unit in 1 interval as
specified by the time base. The timer reading is decreased until it reaches
”0”. The possible range of time is from 0 to 9,990 seconds.

Format of Timer Reading

You can load a predefined timer reading using the following formats:

S In composite time format: TIME#aH_bbM_ccS_dddMS
S In simple format: TIME#2.4H
Evaluation

You can evaluate the result in two different formats:

S As a function result (type S5TIME): in BCD format
S As an output parameter (time without time base in data type WORD): in
binary code


## Counters and Timers


Time Base

Bits 12 and 13 of the timer word contain the time base in binary code. The
time base defines the interval at which the time value is decreased by 1 unit
(see Table 17-9 and Figure 17-2). The shortest time base is 10 ms; the longest
is 10 s.

Note
Since timer readings can only be saved in one time interval, values that do

17.2.2

Pulse Timer

Description

The maximum time for which the output signal remains set to ”1” is the same
as the programmed timer reading.
If, during the runtime of the timer, the signal status 0 appears at the input, the
timer is set to ”0”. This means a premature termination of the timer runtime.

Table 17-10

Method of Operation of Pulse Timer

Function

Explanation

Start time

The ”pulse timer” operation starts the specified timer when the
signal status at the start input (S) changes from ”0” to ”1”. To
enable the timer, a signal change is always required.

Specify runtime

The timer runs using the value at input TV until the programmed
time expires and the input S = 1.

Abort runtime

If input S changes from ”1” to ”0” before the time has expired, the
timer is stopped.

Reset

The time is reset if the reset input (R) changes from ”0” to ”1”
while the timer is running. With this change, both the timer reading
and the time base are reset to zero. The signal status ”1” at input R
has no effect if the timer is not running.

Query signal
status

As long as the timer is running, a signal status query following a
”1” at output Q produces the result ”1”. If the timer is aborted, a
signal status query at output Q produces the result ”0”.

Query current
timer reading

The current timer reading can be queried at output BI and using the
function value S_PULSE.

17.2.3

Extended Pulse Timer

Description

The output signal remains set to ”1” for the programmed time (t) regardless
of how long the input signal remains set to ”1”. Triggering the start pulse
again restarts the counter time so that the output pulse is extended
(retriggering).

and the time base are reset to zero. The signal status ”1” at input R
has no effect if the timer is not running.

Query signal

As long as the timer is running, a signal status query following ”1”
at output Q produces the result ”1” regardless of the length of the
input signal.

17.2.4

On-Delay Timer

Description

The output signal only changes from ”0” to ”1” if the programmed time has
expired and the input signal is still ”1”. This means that the output is
activated following a delay. Input signals that remain active for a time that is
shorter than the programmed time do not appear at the output.

Explanation

Start time

The ”on-delay timer” starts a specified time if the signal status at
the start input (S) changes from ”0” to ”1”. To enable the timer, a
signal change is always required.

Stop timer

If the signal status at input S changes from ”1” to ”0” while the
timer is running, it is stopped.

Specify the
runtime

The timer continues to run with the value at input TV as long as
the signal status at input S = 1.

Reset

The timer is reset if the reset input (R) changes from ”0” to ”1”
while the timer is still running. With this signal change, the timer
reading and the time base are reset to zero. The time is also reset if
R = 1 is set when the timer is not running.

Query signal
status

A signal status query following ”1” at output Q returns ”1” if the
time has expired without an error occurring and input S is still set
to ”1”.
If the timer is stopped, a signal status query following ”1” always
returns ”0”.
A signal status query after ”1” at output Q also returns ”0” if the
timer is not running and the RLO at input S is still ”1”.

The current timer reading can be queried at output BI and using the
function value S_ODT.

Off-Delay Timer

Description

With a signal status change from ”0” to ”1” at start input S, output Q is set to

## 18.1 Converting Data Types


Overview

When you link two addresses of differing data types or assign expressions to
variables, you must check the mutual compatibility of the data types involved
in each case. The following cases would produce incorrect results:

S a change to a different type class, for example, from a bit data type to a
numeric data type;

S a change within a type class if the destination data type is of a lower order
than the source data type.
Therefore, in such cases you must perform an explicit data type conversion.
The necessary details are given in Section 18.2.
If neither of the above cases applies, the compiler forces automatic
conversion to a common format. This type of conversion is referred to from
now on as implicit data type conversion.
Implicit Data Type
Conversions

Within the classes of auxiliary data type listed in Table 18-1, the compiler
performs implicit data type conversions in the order indicated. The common
format of two addresses is taken to be the lowest common standard type
whose value range covers both addresses. Thus, the common format of Byte
and Integer is Integer.
Please note also that in the case of data type conversion within the class
ANY_BIT, leading bits are set to 0.
Table 18-1

Order of Implicit Data Type Conversions
Class

Conversion Order

ANY_BIT

BOOL ⇒ BYTE ⇒ WORD ⇒ DWORD

ANY_NUM

INT ⇒ DINT ⇒ REAL

Example 18-1 illustrates implicit conversion of data types.

PID_CONTROLLER_2:WORD;
END_VAR
BEGIN
IF (PID_CONTROLLER_1 <> PID_CONTROLLER_2) THEN...
(* In the condition for the above IF/THEN
instruction, PID_ CONTROLLER_1 is implicitly
converted to a variable of data type WORD *)
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

SCL Standard Functions


## 18.2 Standard Functions for Data Type Conversions


Explicit Data Type
Conversion

Explicit data type conversions are performed by means of standard functions.
These standard functions are listed in Tables 18-2 and 18-3.


## Function Call


For a detailed description of the function call, refer to Chapter 16.

S Input parameter:
Each function for converting a data type has one input parameter only. This
parameter has the name IN. Since this is a function with only one parameter,
you only need to specify the actual parameter.

S Function value
The result is always the function value. The two tables detail the rules
according to which the data is converted. Table 18-3 also indicates whether
or not the function affects the OK flag.

S Names of the functions
Since the data types of the input parameter and the function value are derived
from the function name in each case, they are not separately itemized in
Tables 18-2 and 18-3. For example, for the function BOOL_TO_BYTE, the
data type of the input parameter is BOOL and the data type of the function
value BYTE.

List of Conversion
Functions
(Class A)

Table 18-2 shows the data type conversion functions of Class A. These
functions are performed implicitly by the compiler or you can specify them
explicitly. The result is always defined.
Table 18-2

Data Type Conversion Functions, Class A

Function Name
BOOL_TO_BYTE

Adds leading zeros

BOOL_TO_DWORD
BOOL_TO_WORD
BYTE_TO_DWORD
BYTE_TO_WORD
CHAR_TO_STRING

Transformation to a string (of length 1) containing the same
character.

DINT_TO_REAL

Transformation to REAL according to the IEEE standard.
The value may change (due to the different resolution of
REAL).

INT_TO_DINT

The higher-order word of the function value is padded with
16#FFFF for a negative input parameter, otherwise it is
padded with zeros. The value remains the same.

INT_TO_REAL

Transformation to REAL according to the IEEE standard.
The value remains the same.

WORD_TO_DWORD

Adds leading zeros


SCL Standard Functions

List of Conversion
Functions
(Class B)

Table 18-3 shows the data type conversion functions of Class B. These
functions must be specified explicitly. The result can also be undefined if the
size of the destination type is insufficient.
You can check for this situation yourself by including a limit check or you
can have the system make the check by selecting the ”OK flag” option prior
to compilation. In situations where the result is undefined, the system then
sets the OK variable to FALSE. Evaluation must be done by yourself.

Note
You also have the option of using IEC functions for data type conversion. In
this case, you should copy the desired function from the STEP 7 library
STDLIBS\IEC to your program directory. For details of individual IEC
functions, refer to /235/.

Examples of
Explicit
Conversions

In Example 18-2 below, an explicit conversion is necessary since the
destination data type is of a lower order than the source data type.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB10
VAR
SWITCH
: INT;
CONTROLLER : DINT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
SWITCH := DINT_TO_INT (CONTROLLER);
(* INT is of a lower order than DINT *)
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Target Data Type does not Match Source Data Type


SCL Standard Functions

In Example 18-3, an explicit data type conversion is necessary, since the data
type REAL is not permissible for a mathematical expression with the MOD
operator.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB20
VAR
intval:INT:=17;
CONV2 := INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
CONV2 := intval MOD REAL_TO_INT (2.3);
(* MOD may only be used for data of the types
INT or DINT. *)
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

Conversion due to Non-Permissible Data Type

In Example 18-4, conversion is necessary because the data type is incorrect
for a logical operator. The NOT operator should only be used for data of the
types BOOL, BYTE, WORD or DWORD.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB30
VAR
intval:INT:=17;
CONV1 :=WORD;
END_VAR
BEGIN
CONV1 := NOT INT_TO_WORD(intval);
(* NOT may only be used for data
of the type INT. *)
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Example:**

18-4 Conversion due to Incorrect Data Type


SCL Standard Functions

Example 18-5 illustrates data type conversion in the case of peripheral
inputs/outputs.

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB40
VAR
radius_on
: WORD;
radius
: INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
radius_on := IB0;
radius
:= WORD_TO_INT(radius_on);
(* Conversion due to change to different type
class. Value comes from input and is converted for
subsequent processing. *)
radius

:= Radius(area:= circledata.area);

QB0

:= WORD_TO_BYTE(INT_TO_WORD(radius));

(* Radius is recalculated from the area and is
present in integer format. For output purposes,
the value is first converted to a different type
class (INT_TO_WORD) and then to a lower-order type
(WORD_TO_BYTE). *)
//...

Function

Each bit string standard function has two input parameters identified by IN
and N. The result is always the function value. Table 18-9 lists the function
names and data types of the two input parameters in each case as well as the
data type of the function value. Explanation of input parameters:

S Input parameter IN: buffer in which bit string operations are performed.
S Input parameter N: number of cycles of the cyclic buffer functions ROL
and ROR or the number of places to be shifted in the case of SHL and
SHR.

table, or the number of the absolute identifier of the block.
In the function call, you must assign the formal parameters, whose names
and data types have been specified when the configurable block was created,
actual parameters with which the block works when the program is running.
All the information you require is given in /235/. This manual provides a
general outline of the basic functions in S7 and, as reference information,
detailed interface descriptions for use in your programs.

Example of SFC 31

The following command lines enable you to call the system function SFC 31
(query time of day interrupt):

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB20
VAR
Result:INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
//...
Result:= SFC 31 (OB_NR:= 10,STATUS:= MW100 );
//...
//...
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK


**Example:**

Querying the Time-Of-Day Interrupt

Results
The data type of the function value is Integer. If its value is > = 0 this
indicates that the block has been processed without errors. If the value is < 0,
an error has occurred. After calling the function, you can check the implicitly
defined output parameter ENO.
Conditional

## Function Call


For a conditional function call, you must set the predefined input parameter
EN to 0 (foe example, via input I0.3). The block is then not called. If EN is
set to 1, the function is called. The output parameter ENO is also set to ”1”
in this case (otherwise ”0”) if no error occurs during processing of the block.


Function Call Interface

Note
In the case of function blocks or system function blocks, the information that
can be passed over by means of the function value in the case of a function
must be stored in output parameters. These are then subsequently read via
the instance data block. For more detailed information, refer to Chapter 16.


Function Call Interface


## 19.2 Data Transfer Interface with OBs


Organization
Blocks

Organization blocks form the interface between the CPU operating system
and the application program. OBs can be used to execute specific program
sections in the following situations:

S when the CPU is powered up
S as cyclic or timed operations
S at specific times or on specific days
S on expiry of a specified time period
S if errors occur
S if process or communications interrupts are triggered
Organization blocks are processed according to the priority they are assigned.

Available OBs

Not all CPUs can process all OBs provided by S7. Refer to the data sheets for
your CPU to find out which OBs you can use.

Additional
Information

Additional information can be obtained from the on-line help and the
following manuals:

S /70/ Manual: S7-300 Programmable Controller, Hardware and
Installation
This manual contains the data sheets which describe the performance
specifications of the various S7-300 CPUs. This also includes the possible
start events for each OB.

S /100/ Manual: S7-400/M7-400 Programmable Controllers, Hardware and
Installation
This manual contains the data sheets which describe the performance
specifications of the various S7-400 CPUs. This also includes the possible
start events for each OB.

Overview

What is a Syntax
Diagram?

The syntax diagram is a graphical representation of the structure of the
language. That structure is defined by a series of rules. One rule may be
based on others at a more fundamental level.

Example of a Syntax Diagram

The syntax diagram is read from left to right and should conform to the
following rule structures:

S Sequence: a sequence of blocks
S Option: a skippable branch
S Iteration: repetition of branches
S Alternative: a split into multiple branches
What Types of
Blocks Are There?

A block is a basic element or an element made up of other blocks. The
diagram below shows the symbols that represent the various types of block.

<Rule name>

Basic element that requires no further
explanation
This refers to printing characters and
special characters, keywords and
predefined identifiers. The information
in these blocks must be copied as it is
shown.

Rule name may use upper
or lower case letters

additional syntax diagrams.

Rule name must always be in
upper case letters!
Complex element used as a basic
element in the syntax rules and
explained in the lexical rules.

Formal Description of Language

Rules

The rules which you apply to the structure of your SCL program are
subdivided into the categories lexical and syntax rules.


## Lexical Rules


The lexical rules describe the structure of the elements (tokens) processed
during the lexical analysis performed by the Compiler. For this reason lexical
rules are not free-format; that is, they must be strictly observed. In particular,
this means that

S insertion of formatting characters is not permitted,
S insertion of remarks blocks and lines is not permitted,
S insertion of attributes for identifiers is not permitted.

Example of a Lexical Rule

The above example shows the lexical rule for IDENTIFIER. It defines the
structure of an identifier (name), for example:
MEAS_ARRAY_12
SETPOINT_B_1


## Syntax Rules


The syntax rules are built up from the lexical rules and define the structure of
SCL. Within the limitations of those rules the structure of the your SCL
program is free-format.

Rule Categories and Format Restrictions


Formal Description of Language

Formal
Considerations

Each rule has a name which precedes the definition. If that rule is used in a
higher-level rule, that name appears in the higher-level rule as a non term. If
the rule name is written in upper case, it is a token that is described in the
lexical rules.

Semantics

The rules can only represent the formal structure of the language. The
meaning; that is, the semantics, is not always obvious from the rules. For this
reason, where it is important, additional information is written next to the
rule. The following are examples of such situations:

S Where there are elements of the same type with different meanings, an
additional name is specified, for example, in the Date Specification rule
the explanatory names Year, Month or Day are added to the element
DECIMAL_DIGIT_STRING.

S Where there are important limitations, these are noted alongside the rule,
for example, in the case of Symbol, the fact that it has to be defined in the
symbol editor.


Formal Description of Language

A.2

Overview of Terms

Definition

A term is a basic element that can not be explained by another rule but is
represented verbally. In a syntax diagram, it is represented by the following
symbol:

A term is represented by an oblong with rounded
corners or a circle. The item is shown in literal
terms or as a name (in upper case letters).
This defines the range of ASCII characters that
can be used.

Figure A-5

Summary

Symbols for Terms

In Sections A.3 to A.4 the types of use for different characters are explained.
The various types of character are as follows:

S letters, numbers, printing characters and special characters,
S formatting characters and delimiters in the lexical rules,
S prefixes for literals
S formatting characters and delimiters in the syntax rules
S operators
Sections A.5 and A.6 deal with keywords and predefined identifiers made up
of character strings. The tables are arranged in alphabetical order. In the
event of differences between SIMATIC and IEC mnemonics, the
corresponding IEC mnemonic is shown as well.

Overview of Non Terms

Definition

A non term is a complex element that is described by another rule. A non
term is represented by an oblong box. The name in the box is the name of the
more specific rule.

A.8

Overview of Tokens

Definition

A token is a complex element used as a basic element in syntax rules and
explained in the lexical rules. A token is represented by an oblong box. The
NAME, written in upper case letters, is the name of the explanatory lexical
rule (not shown inside a box).

user-defined names, for example, for variables, and symbols defined in the
symbol table are no longer case-sensitive. Table A-11 summarises the
requirements.

## A.10 Naming Conventions in SCL


User-Defined
Names

There are generally two options when creating user-defined names:

S You can assign names within SCL itself. Such names must conform to the
rule IDENTIFIER (see Figure A-8). IDENTIFIER is the general term you
can use for any name in SCL.

S Alternatively, you can assign the name via STEP 7 using the symbol
table. The rule to be applied in this case is also IDENTIFIER or, as an
additional option, Symbol. By putting your entry in inverted commas, you
can write the symbol with all printable characters (for example, spaces).

Lexical Rules IDENTIFIER and Symbol

Please observe the following rules:

S Choose names that are unambiguous and self-explanatory and which
enhance the comprehensibility of the program.

S Check that the name is not already in use by the system, for example as
an identifier for a data type or standard function.

S Limits of applicability: names that apply globally are valid throughout the
whole program, locally valid names on the other hand apply only within a
specific block. This enables you to use the same names in different
blocks. Table A-12 details the various options available.


Formal Description of Language

Naming
Restrictions

When assigning names, you must observe the following restrictions:
A name must be unique within the limits of its own applicability, that is,
names already used within a particular block can not be used again within the
same block. In addition, the following names reserved by the system may not
be used:

S Names of keywords: for example, CONST, END_CONST, BEGIN
S Names of operators: for example, AND, XOR
S Names of predefined identifiers: e.g. names of data types such as BOOL,
STRING, INT

S Names of the predefined constants TRUE and FALSE
S Names of standard functions: for example, ABS, ACOS, ASIN, COS,
LN

S Names of absolute address identifiers for global system data: for example,
IB, IW, ID, QB, QW, QD MB, MD

Block Attributes


The lexical rules describe the structure of the elements (tokens) processed
during lexical analysis performed by the Compiler. For this reason lexical
rules are not free-format; in other words, they must be strictly observed. In
particular, this means that:

S Insertion of formatting characters is not permitted.
S Insertion of comment blocks and lines is not permitted.
S Insertion of attributes for identifiers is not permitted.
Categories

The lexical rules are subdivided into the following categories:

S Identifiers
S Literals
S Absolute addresses

## Syntax Rules


Definition

Chapter
Overview

Formal
Considerations

The syntax rules develop from the lexical rules and describe the structure of
SCL. Within the framework of these rules, you can create your SCL program
without format restrictions.

## Control Statements


Each rule has a name which precedes it. If a rule is used in a higher-level
rule, its name appears in an oblong box.
If the name in the oblong box is written in upper case letters, this means it is
a token, which is described in the lexical rules.
In Appendix A you will find information about rule names which appear in a
box with rounded corners or a circle.

Points to Note

The free-format characteristic means the following:

S You can insert formatting characters at any point.
S You can insert comment blocks and lines (see Section 7.6).
